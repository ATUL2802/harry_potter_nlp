      "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\" Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing . . .\" Dudley's birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he  wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\" Don't ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put  together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\" Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty . . . thirty . . .\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction. Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. \"What about what's-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \". . . and leave him in the car. . . .\" \"That cars new, he's not sitting in it alone. . . .\" Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying — it had been years since he'd really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I . . . don't . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly . . .\" But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \". . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don't,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" The snake nodded vigorously. \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see — so you've never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He  couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n"

      "Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat's, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh. Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them. \"My Lord . . .\" he choked, \"my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise . . .\" \"Hold out your arm,\" said Voldemort lazily. \"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master . . .\" He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again. \"The other arm, Wormtail.\" \"Master, please . . . please . . .\" Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo — a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth — the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping. \"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it . . . and now, we shall see . . . now we shall know . . .\" He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. The scar on Harry's forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard. \"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\" he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \"And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face. \"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\" he hissed softly. \"A Muggle and a fool . . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. . . .\" Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass. \"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. . . . He didn't like magic, my father . . . \"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born, Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him . . . I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\" Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. \"Listen to me, reliving family history . . .\" he said quietly, \"why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\" The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes. Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort, and kissed the hem of his black robes. \"Master . . . Master . . .\" he murmured. The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle's grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind, a rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered. \"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years . . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday. . . . We are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\" He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like nostrils widening. \"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench of guilt upon the air.\" A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare, to step back from him. \"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact — such prompt appearances! — and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\" No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. \"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must haveCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . . \"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living? \"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort . . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\" At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them. \"It is a disappointment to me . . . I confess myself disappointed. . . .\" One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet. \"Master!\" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\" Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . . . anything . . . Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. \"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years . . . I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\" He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob. \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please, Master . . . please . . .\" \"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers. . . .\" Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtail's bleeding wrist. Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. \"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master . . . it is beautiful . . . thank you . . . thank you. . . .\" He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort. \"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\" Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay . . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\" \"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me —\" \"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. . . . I expect more faithful service in the future.\" \"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. . . .\" Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space — large enough for two people — that separated Malfoy and the next man. \"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us . . . they are our natural allies . . . we will recall the banished giants . . . I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. . . .\" He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. \"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. . . .\" \"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair. \"And here\" — Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures — \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\" They bowed clumsily, muttering dully. \"Yes, Master . . .\" \"We will, Master. . . .\" \"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyle's shadow. \"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful —\" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort. He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there. \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return . . . he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever . . . he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. \"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . . \"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\" There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Worm-tail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. \"Master, we crave to know . . . we beg you to tell us . . . how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. . . .\" \"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins — and ends — with my young friend here.\" He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle. \"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him — and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. . . . I could not touch the boy.\" Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek. \"His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it . . . but no matter. I can touch him now.\" Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know . . . I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal — to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked . . . for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself . . . for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . . \"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. . . . I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me . . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . . but I waited in vain. . . .\" The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE I sometimes inhabited animals — snakes, of course, being my preference — but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . . \"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard — young, foolish, and gullible — wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of . . . for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school . . . he was easy to bend to my will . . . he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. . . .\" Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry. \"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\" Voldemort continued. \"I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour . . . I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. . . .\" One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice. \"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last . . . a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . . \"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic. \"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail — displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him — convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her . . . he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams . . . for — with a little persuasion — she became a veritable mine of information. \"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things . . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless. \"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth . . . a spell or two of my own invention . . . a little help from my dear Nagini,\" Voldemort's red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \"a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided . . . I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel. \"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower . . . I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength. \"I knew that to achieve this — it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight — I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . . \"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe . . . Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me . . . as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potter's blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . . . \"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. . . . I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggle-loving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him? \"Why . . . by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament — that he touched the Triwizard Cup first — the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is . . . the boy you all believed had been my downfall. . . .\" Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar;CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end . . . to black out . . . to die . . . And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter. \"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\" said Voldemort. \"But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\" he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching. \"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\"\n",

      "It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking. \"You're both mental.\" \"Ridiculous!\" said Hermione faintly. \"Peter Pettigrew's dead!\" said Harry. \"He killed him twelve years ago!\" He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively. \"I meant to,\" he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \"but little Peter got the better of me . . . not this time, though!\" And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg. \"Sirius, NO!\" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \"WAIT! You can't do it just like that — they need to understand — we've got to explain —\" \"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he tried to escape. \"They've — got — a — right — to — know — everything!\" Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \"Ron's kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don't understand! And Harry — you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!\" Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, and bleeding hands. \"All right, then,\" Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat. \"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for. . . .\" \"You're nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. \"I've had enough of this. I'm off.\" He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers. \"You're going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\" \"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him and pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin. \"There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" he said. \"A whole street full of them . . .\"MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS \"They didn't see what they thought they saw!\" said Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands. \"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,\" said Lupin, nodding. \"I believed it myself — until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map never lies . . . Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry.\" Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all — but why was Lupin playing along with him? Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly. \"But Professor Lupin . . . Scabbers can't be Pettigrew . . . it just can't be true, you know it can't . . .\" \"Why can't it be true?\" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows. \"Because . . . because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things . . . and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the list —\" Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.  \"Right again, Hermione!\" he said. \"But the Ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\" \"If you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. \"I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.\" \"All right . . . but you'll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, \"I only know how it began . . .\" Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing. \"No one there . . .\" \"This place is haunted!\" said Ron. \"It's not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The Shrieking Shack was never haunted. . . . The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\" He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment, then said, \"That's where all of this starts — with my becoming a werewolf. None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitten . . . and if I hadn't been so foolhardy. . . .\" He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione said, \"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently. \"I was a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform. . . . I am able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again. \"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children exposed to me. \"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn't come to school. . . .\" Lupin sighed, and looked directly at Harry. \"I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts. This house\" — Lupin looked miserably around the room, — \"the tunnel that leads to it — they were built for my use. Once a month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous.\" Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he was listening raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin's voice was Scabbers's frightened squeaking. \"My transformations in those days were — were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor. . . . Even now, when the house has been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it. . . . \"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black . . . Peter Pettigrew . . . and, of course, your father, Harry — James Potter. \"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her. . . . I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth. . . . \"And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.\" \"My dad too?\" said Harry, astounded. \"Yes, indeed,\" said Lupin. \"It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.\" \"But how did that help you?\" said Hermione, sounding puzzled. \"They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,\" said Lupin. \"A werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak. They transformed . . . Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then slip down the tunnel and joinMOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS me. Under their influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them.\" \"Hurry up, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face. \"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there . . . well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. . . . And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.\" \"What sort of animal — ?\" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off. \"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?\" \"A thought that still haunts me,\" said Lupin heavily. \"And there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness.\" \"I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course . . . he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month's adventure. And I haven't changed . . . Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. \"All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others along with me . . . and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it . . . so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along.\" \"Snape?\" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \"What's Snape got to do with it?\" \"He's here, Sirius,\" said Lupin heavily. \"He's teaching here as well.\" He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons . . . you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me —\" Black made a derisive noise. \"It served him right,\" he sneered. \"Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to . . . hoping he could get us expelled. . . .\"MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS \"Severus was very interested in where I went every month.\" Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"We were in the same year, you know, and we — er — didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field . . . anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be — er — amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it — if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf — but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life . . . Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was. . . .\" \"So that's why Snape doesn't like you,\" said Harry slowly, \"because he thought you were in on the joke?\" \"That's right,\" sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin. Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing directly at Lupin.\n",

      "Clutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn't stop grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it. \"Seats a hundred thousand,\" said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on Harry's face. \"Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they've suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again . . . bless them,\" he added fondly, leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards. \"Prime seats!\" said the Ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets. \"Top Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.\" The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They clambered upward with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley's party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts. About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined. A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field. Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. The field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of the field stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry's eye level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giant's hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field. The Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family — safe, reliable, and with Built-in Anti-Burglar Buzzer . . . Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No Pain, No Stain! . . . Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris, Hogsmeade . . . Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them. The creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . . \"Dobby?\" said Harry incredulously. The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn't Dobby — it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry's friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family. \"Did sir just call me Dobby?\" squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby's had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected — though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf — that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest. \"Sorry,\" Harry told the elf, \"I just thought you were someone I knew.\" \"But I knows Dobby too, sir!\" squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit. \"My name is Winky, sir — and you, sir —\" Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry's scar. \"You is surely Harry Potter!\" \"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry. \"But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!\" she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck. \"How is he?\" said Harry. \"How's freedom suiting him?\" \"Ah, sir,\" said Winky, shaking her head, \"ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.\" \"Why?\" said Harry, taken aback. \"What's wrong with him?\" \"Freedom is going to Dobby's head, sir,\" said Winky sadly. \"Ideas above his station, sir. Can't get another position, sir.\" \"Why not?\" said Harry. Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, \"He is wanting paying for his work, sir.\" \"Paying?\" said Harry blankly. \"Well — why shouldn't he be paid?\" Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden again. \"House-elves is not paid, sir!\" she said in a muffled squeak. \"No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you's up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.\" \"Well, it's about time he had a bit of fun,\" said Harry. \"House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,\" said Winky firmly, from behind her hands. \"House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter\" — she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped — \"but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.\" \"Why's he sent you up here, if he knows you don't like heights?\" said Harry, frowning. \"Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very busy,\" said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her. \"Winky is wishing she is back in master's tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.\" She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again. Harry turned back to the others. \"So that's a house-elf?\" Ron muttered. \"Weird things, aren't they?\" \"Dobby was weirder,\" said Harry fervently. Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium. \"Wild!\" he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. \"I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again . . . and again . . . and again . . .\" Hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvet-covered, tasseled program. \" 'A display from the team mascots will precede the match,' \" she read aloud. \"Oh that's always worth watching,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.\" The box filled gradually around them over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards. Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself, arrived, Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. Highly embarrassed, he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like an old friend. They had met before, and Fudge shook Harry's hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him. \"Harry Potter, you know,\" he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn't seem to understand a word of English. \"Harry Potter . . . oh come on now, you know who he is . . . the boy who survived You-Know-Who . . . you do know who he is —\" The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry's scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it. \"Knew we'd get there in the end,\" said Fudge wearily to Harry. \"I'm no great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see his house-elf's saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here's Lucius!\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the house-elf's former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco's mother. Harry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly resembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have been nice-looking if she hadn't been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose. \"Ah, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the Minister of Magic. \"How are you? I don't think you've met my wife, Narcissa? Or our son, Draco?\" \"How do you do, how do you do?\" said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs. Malfoy. \"And allow me to introduce you to Mr. Oblansk — Obalonsk — Mr. — well, he's the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he can't understand a word I'm saying anyway, so never mind. And let's see who else — you know Arthur Weasley, I daresay?\" It was a tense moment. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy looked at each other and Harry vividly recalled the last time they had come face-to-face: It had been in Flourish and Blotts' bookshop, and they had had a fight. Mr. Malfoy's cold gray eyes swept over Mr. Weasley, and then up and down the row. \"Good lord, Arthur,\" he said softly. \"What did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn't have fetched this much?\" Fudge, who wasn't listening, said, \"Lucius has just given a very generous contribution to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur. He's here as my guest.\" \"How — how nice,\" said Mr. Weasley, with a very strained smile. Mr. Malfoy's eyes had returned to Hermione, who went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at him. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr. Malfoy's lip curl like that. The Malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, second-class. However, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic, Mr. Malfoy did-n't dare say anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley and continued down the line to his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron, and Hermione one contemptuous look, then settled himself between his mother and father. \"Slimy gits,\" Ron muttered as he, Harry, and Hermione turned to face the field again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box. \"Everyone ready?\" he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam. \"Minister — ready to go?\" \"Ready when you are, Ludo,\" said Fudge comfortably. Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said \"Sonorus!\" and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands. \"Ladies and gentlemen . . . welcome! Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!\" The spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans — A Risk With Every Mouthful!) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0. \"And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce . . . the Bulgarian National Team Mascots!\" The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval. \"I wonder what they've brought,\" said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his seat. \"Aaah!\" He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. \"Veela!\" \"What are veel — ?\" But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry's question was answered for him. Veela were women . . . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen . . . except that they weren't — they couldn't be — human. This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind . . . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human — in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all. The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. . . . And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea . . . but would it be good enough? \"Harry, what are you doing?\" said Hermione's voice from a long way off. The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard. Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn't want the  veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands. \"You'll be wanting that,\" he said, \"once Ireland have had their say. \"Huh?\" said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field. Hermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back into his seat. \"Honestly!\" she said. \"And now,\" roared Ludo Bagman's voice, \"kindly put your wands in the air . . . for the Irish National Team Mascots!\" Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came zooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts. A rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands. Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it — \"Excellent!\" yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats. Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green. \"Leprechauns!\" said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold. \"There you go,\" Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry's hand, \"for the Omnioculars! Now you've got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!\" The great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to watch the match. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome — the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you — Dimitrov!\" A scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian supporters. \"Ivanova!\" A second scarlet-robed player zoomed out. \"Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand — Krum!\" \"That's him, that's him!\" yelled Ron, following Krum with his Omnioculars. Harry quickly focused his own. Viktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to believe he was only eighteen. \"And now, please greet — the Irish National Quidditch Team!\" yelled Bagman. \"Presenting — Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand — Lynch!\" Seven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a small dial on the side of his Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word \"Firebolt\" on each of their brooms and see their names, embroidered in silver, upon their backs. \"And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!\" A small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival Uncle Vernon's, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other. Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open — four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls. \"Theeeeeeeey're OFF!\" screamed Bagman. \"And it's Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!\" It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose. The speed of the players was incredible — the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names. Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums. HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran's path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it — \"TROY SCORES!\" roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. \"Ten zero to Ireland!\" \"What?\" Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. \"But Levski's got the Quaffle!\" \"Harry, if you're not going to watch at normal speed, you're going to miss things!\" shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omni-oculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily. Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed. Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another's minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry's chest kept squeaking their names: \"Troy — Mullet — Moran!\" And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters. The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria's first goal. \"Fingers in your ears!\" bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle. \"Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova — oh I say!\" roared Bagman. One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was — \"They're going to crash!\" screamed Hermione next to Harry. She was half right — at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats. \"Fool!\" moaned Mr. Weasley. \"Krum was feinting!\" \"It's time-out!\" yelled Bagman's voice, \"as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan Lynch!\" \"He'll be okay, he only got ploughed!\" Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. \"Which is what Krum was after, of course. . . .\" Harry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes. He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. WRONSKI DEFENSIVE FEINT — DANGEROUS SEEKER DIVERSION read the shining purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum's face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood — Krum hadn't seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum's face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference. Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters, mounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far. After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals. They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier. As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn't catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa's long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul. \"And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing — excessive use of elbows!\" Bagman informed the roaring spectators. \"And — yes, it's a penalty to Ireland!\" The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words \"HA, HA, HA!\" The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again. As one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers into their ears, but Hermione, who hadn't bothered, was soon tugging on Harry's arm. He turned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears. \"Look at the referee!\" she said, giggling. Harry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly. \"Now, we can't have that!\" said Ludo Bagman, though he sounded highly amused. \"Somebody slap the referee!\" A mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own ears, and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself; Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous. \"And unless I'm much mistaken, Mostafa is actually attempting to send off the Bulgarian team mascots!\" said Bagman's voice. \"Now there's something we haven't seen before. . . . Oh this could turn nasty. . . .\" It did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, landed on either side of Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him, gesticulating toward the leprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words \"HEE, HEE, HEE.\" Mostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarians' arguments, however; he was jabbing his finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and when they refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle. \"Two penalties for Ireland!\" shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd howled with anger. \"And Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms . . . yes . . . there they go . . . and Troy takes the Quaffle . . .\" Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom. \"Foul !\" roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green. \"Foul!\" echoed Ludo Bagman's magically magnified voice. \"Dimitrov skins Moran — deliberately flying to collide there — and it's got to be another penalty — yes, there's the whistle!\" The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn't look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders — \"And that, boys,\" yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, \"is why you should never go for looks alone!\" Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above. Harry turned this way and that, staring through his Omnioculars, as the Quaffle changed hands with the speed of a bullet. \"Levski — Dimitrov — Moran — Troy — Mullet — Ivanova — Moran again — Moran — MORAN SCORES!\" But the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela, the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members' wands, and the furious roars of the Bulgarians. The game recommenced immediately; now Levski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov — The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in the face. There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum's nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn't blow his whistle. He had become distracted, and Harry couldn't blame him; one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight. Harry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured; even though he was supporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting player on the field. Ron obviously felt the same. \"Time-out! Ah, come on, he can't play like that, look at him —\" \"Look at Lynch!\" Harry yelled. For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry  was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing. . . . \"He's seen the Snitch!\" Harry shouted. \"He's seen it! Look at him go!\" Half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening; the Irish supporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on . . . but Krum was on his tail. How he could see where he was going, Harry had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again — \"They're going to crash!\" shrieked Hermione. \"They're not!\" roared Ron. \"Lynch is!\" yelled Harry. And he was right — for the second time, Lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela. \"The Snitch, where's the Snitch?\" bellowed Charlie, along the row. \"He's got it — Krum's got it — it's all over!\" shouted Harry. Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand. The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170 across the crowd, who didn't seem to have realized what had happened. Then, slowly, as though a great jumbo jet were revving up, the rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight. \"IRELAND WINS!\" Bagman shouted, who like the Irish, seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match.  \"KRUM GETS THE SNITCH — BUT IRELAND WINS — good lord, I don't think any of us were expecting that!\" \"What did he catch the Snitch for?\" Ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and down, applauding with his hands over his head. \"He ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!\" \"He knew they were never going to catch up!\" Harry shouted back over all the noise, also applauding loudly. \"The Irish Chasers were too good. . . . He wanted to end it on his terms, that's all. . . .\" \"He was very brave, wasn't he?\" Hermione said, leaning forward to watch Krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him. \"He looks a terrible mess. . . .\" Harry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was hard to see what was happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards. He looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up. His team members were around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the Irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots. Flags were waving all over the stadium, the Irish national anthem blared from all sides; the veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn. \"Vell, ve fought bravely,\" said a gloomy voice behind Harry. He looked around; it was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic. \"You can speak English!\" said Fudge, sounding outraged. \"And you've been letting me mime everything all day!\" \"Vell, it vos very funny,\" said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging. \"And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!\" roared Bagman. Harry's eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside. Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he'd been using sign language all day for nothing. \"Let's have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!\" Bagman shouted. And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction. One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground. He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when Krum's name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar. And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused. But he grinned  happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Harry's hands were numb with clapping. At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Connolly's, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, \"Quietus.\" \"They'll be talking about this one for years,\" he said hoarsely, \"a really unexpected twist, that. . . . shame it couldn't have lasted longer. . . . Ah yes. . . . yes, I owe you . . . how much?\" For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched.\n",

      "Mrs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim. \"I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,\" she said as they reached the first landing. \"We've got a busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginny's asleep,\" she added to Hermione, \"so try not to wake her up.\" \"Asleep, yeah, right,\" said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade them good night and they were climbing to the next floor. \"If Ginny's not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs, then I'm a flobberworm. . . .\" \"All right, Ron, Harry,\" said Mrs. Weasley on the second landing, pointing them into their bedroom. \"Off to bed with you.\" \" 'Night,\" Harry and Ron said to the twins. \"Sleep tight,\" said Fred, winking. Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight. The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry put on his pajamas, took off his glasses, and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly. \"We can't let them out to hunt every night,\" Ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pajamas. \"Dumbledore doesn't want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks it'll look suspicious. Oh yeah . . . I forgot. . . .\" He crossed to the door and bolted it. \"What're you doing that for?\" \"Kreacher,\" said Ron as he turned off the light. \"First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you don't want to wake up and find him prowling around your room. Anyway . . .\" He got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then turned to look at Harry in the darkness. Harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window. \"What d'you reckon?\" Harry didn't need to ask what Ron meant. \"Well, they didn't tell us much we couldn't have guessed, did they?\" he said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs. \"I mean, all they've really said is that the Order's trying to stop people joining Vol —\" There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron. \"— demort,\" said Harry firmly. \"When are you going to start using his name? Sirius and Lupin do.\" Ron ignored this last comment. \"Yeah, you're right,\" he said. \"We already knew nearly everything they told us, from using the Extend-able Ears. The only new bit was —\" Crack. \"OUCH!\" \"Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum'll be back up here.\" \"You two just Apparated on my knees!\" \"Yeah, well, it's harder in the dark —\" Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from Ron's bed. There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry's mattress descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet. \"So, got there yet?\" said George eagerly. \"The weapon Sirius mentioned?\" said Harry. \"Let slip, more like,\" said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron. \"We didn't hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?\" \"What d'you reckon it is?\" said Harry. \"Could be anything,\" said Fred. \"But there can't be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there?\" said Ron. \"What's worse than death?\" \"Maybe it's something that can kill loads of people at once,\" suggested George. \"Maybe it's some particularly painful way of killing people,\" said Ron fearfully. \"He's got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,\" said Harry. \"He doesn't need anything more efficient than that.\" There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate. \"So who d'you thinks got it now?\" asked George. \"I hope it's our side,\" said Ron, sounding slightly nervous. \"If it is, Dumbledore's probably keeping it,\" said Fred. \"Where?\" said Ron quickly. \"Hogwarts?\" \"Bet it is!\" said George. \"That's where he hid the Sorcerer's Stone!\" \"A weapon's going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!\" said Ron. \"Not necessarily,\" said Fred. \"Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,\" said George. \"Look at Ginny.\" \"What d'you mean?\" said Harry. \"You've never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?\" \"Shhh!\" said Fred, half-rising from the bed. \"Listen!\" They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs again. \"Mum,\" said George, and without further ado there was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few seconds later and they heard the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs. Weasley was plainly listening to see whether they were talking or not. Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George. \"She doesn't trust us at all, you know,\" said Ron regretfully. Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs. . . . In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, \"Beauties, aren' they, eh, Harry? We'll be studyin' weapons this term. . . .\" And Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him. . . . He ducked. . . . The next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball under his bedclothes, and George's loud voice was filling the room. \"Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxies than she thought and she's found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.\" Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive-green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long, moss-green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths. Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end. \"Cover your faces and take a spray,\" Mrs. Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table. \"It's Doxycide. I've never seen an infestation this bad — what that house-elf 's been doing for the last ten years —\" Hermione's face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at Mrs. Weasley at these words. \"Kreacher's really old, he probably couldn't manage —\" \"You'd be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to, Hermione,\" said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. \"I've just been feeding Buckbeak,\" he added, in reply to Harry's inquiring look. \"I keep him upstairs in my mother's bedroom. Anyway . . . this writing desk . . .\" He dropped the bag of rats onto an armchair, then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time, was shaking slightly. \"Well, Molly, I'm pretty sure this is a boggart,\" said Sirius, peering through the keyhole, \"but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out — knowing my mother it could be something much worse.\" \"Right you are, Sirius,\" said Mrs. Weasley. They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before. A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand. \"I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!\" said Sirius exasperatedly, hurrying back out of the room. They heard him thundering down the stairs as Mrs. Black's screeches echoed up through the house once more: \"Stains of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children of filth . . .\" \"Close the door, please, Harry,\" said Mrs. Weasley. Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing room door; he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs. Sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mother's portrait because she had stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a deep voice he recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt's saying, \"Hestia's just relieved me, so she's got Moody's cloak now, thought I'd leave a report for Dumbledore. . . .\" Feeling Mrs. Weasley's eyes on the back of his head, Harry regretfully closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party. Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on the sofa. \"Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and their teeth are poisonous. I've got a bottle of antidote here, but I'd rather nobody needed it.\" She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains, and beckoned them all forward. \"When I say the word, start spraying immediately,\" she said. \"They'll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyze them. When they're immobilized, just throw them in this bucket.\" She stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own spray. \"All right — squirt!\" Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully grown doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetlelike wings whirring, tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury. Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud thunk, onto the worn carpet below. Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket. \"Fred, what are you doing?\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply. \"Spray that at once and throw it away!\" Harry looked around. Fred was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb. \"Right-o,\" Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs. Weasley's back was turned he pocketed it with a wink. \"We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snack-boxes,\" George told Harry under his breath. Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his nose, Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of his mouth, \"What are Skiving Snackboxes?\" \"Range of sweets to make you ill,\" George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs. Weasley's back. \"Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing them this summer. They're double-ended, color-coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you've been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half —\" \" '— which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom.' That's what we're putting in the adverts, anyway,\" whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs. Weasley's line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxies from the floor and adding them to his pocket. \"But they still need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end.\" \"Testers?\" \"Us,\" said Fred. \"We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies — we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat —\" \"Mum thought we'd been dueling,\" said George. \"Joke shop still on, then?\" Harry muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray. \"Well, we haven't had a chance to get premises yet,\" said Fred, dropping his voice even lower as Mrs. Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack, \"so we're running it as a mail-order service at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week.\" \"All thanks to you, mate,\" said George. \"But don't worry . . . Mum hasn't got a clue. She won't read the Daily Prophet anymore, 'cause of it telling lies about you and Dumbledore.\" Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand-Galleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs. Weasley, who did not think that running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons. The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was past midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf, sank into a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of disgust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious doxies lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks. \"I think we'll tackle those after lunch.\" Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece. They were crammed with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Harry could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was quite sure was blood. The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs. Weasley. \"Stay here,\" she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs. Blacks screeches started up again from down below. \"I'll bring up some sandwiches.\" She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once, everyone dashed over to the window to look down onto the doorstep. They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons. \"Mundungus!\" said Hermione. \"What's he brought all those cauldrons for?\" \"Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,\" said Harry. \"Isn't that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy cauldrons?\" \"Yeah, you're right!\" said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view. \"Blimey, Mum won't like that. . . .\" He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening intently. Mrs. Black's screaming had stopped again. \"Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,\" Fred muttered, frowning with concentration. \"Can't hear properly . . . d'you reckon we can risk the Extendable Ears?\" \"Might be worth it,\" said George. \"I could sneak upstairs and get a pair —\" But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of them could hear exactly what Mrs. Weasley was shouting at the top of her voice. \"WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS!\" \"I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,\" said Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs. Weasley's voice to permeate the room better. \"It makes such a nice change.\" \"— COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE —\" \"The idiots are letting her get into her stride,\" said George, shaking his head. \"You've got to head her off early, otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours. And she's been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry — and there goes Sirius's mum again —\" Mrs. Weasley's voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall. George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room. Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery gray, and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike. The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, toward the far end of the room, muttering under its breath all the while in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog's, \". . . Smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she's no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my Mistress's house, oh my poor Mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they've let in her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he do. . . .\" \"Hello, Kreacher,\" said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap. The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and then gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise. \"Kreacher did not see Young Master,\" he said, turning around and bowing to Fred. Still facing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, \"Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.\" \"Sorry?\" said George. \"Didn't catch that last bit.\" \"Kreacher said nothing,\" said the elf, with a second bow to George, adding in a clear undertone, \"and there's its twin, unnatural little beasts they are.\" Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up, eyeing them all very malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter. \". . . and there's the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my Mistress knew, oh how she'd cry, and there's a new boy, Kreacher doesn't know his name, what is he doing here, Kreacher doesn't know . . .\" \"This is Harry, Kreacher,\" said Hermione tentatively. \"Harry Potter.\" Kreacher's pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever. \"The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher's Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would she say —\" \"Don't call her a Mudblood!\" said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily. \"It doesn't matter,\" Hermione whispered, \"he's not in his right mind, he doesn't know what he's —\" \"Don't kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he's saying,\" said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike. Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry. \"Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that's that boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it —\" \"Don't we all, Kreacher?\" said Fred. \"What do you want anyway?\" George asked. Kreacher's huge eyes darted onto George. \"Kreacher is cleaning,\" he said evasively. \"A likely story,\" said a voice behind Harry. Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs. Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen. At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor. \"Stand up straight,\" said Sirius impatiently. \"Now, what are you up to?\" \"Kreacher is cleaning,\" the elf repeated. \"Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black —\" \"— and it's getting blacker every day, it's filthy,\" said Sirius. \"Master always liked his little joke,\" said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, \"Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother's heart —\" \"My mother didn't have a heart, Kreacher,\" Sirius snapped. \"She kept herself alive out of pure spite.\" Kreacher bowed again and said, \"Whatever Master says,\" then muttered furiously, \"Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother's boots, oh my poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was —\" \"I asked you what you were up to,\" said Sirius coldly. \"Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we can't throw it out.\" \"Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master's house,\" said the elf, then muttered very fast, \"Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it's been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it —\" \"I thought it might be that,\" said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall. \"She'll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I don't doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go away, Kreacher.\" It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was redolent of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room. \"— comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh my poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he's back, they say he's a murderer too —\" \"Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!\" said Sirius irritably, and he slammed the door shut on the elf. \"Sirius, he's not right in the head,\" said Hermione pleadingly, \"I don't think he realizes we can hear him.\" \"He's been alone too long,\" said Sirius, \"taking mad orders from my mother's portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little —\" \"If you just set him free,\" said Hermione hopefully, \"maybe —\" \"We can't set him free, he knows too much about the Order,\" said Sirius curtly. \"And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it.\" Sirius walked across the room, where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed. The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as though doxies had gnawed it in places; nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read: The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black \"Toujours Pur\" \"You're not on here!\" said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the tree. \"I used to be there,\" said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. \"My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home — Kreacher's quite fond of muttering the story under his breath.\" \"You ran away from home?\" \"When I was about sixteen,\" said Sirius. \"I'd had enough.\" \"Where did you go?\" asked Harry, staring at him. \"Your dad's place,\" said Sirius. \"Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad's during the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold — he's been wiped off here too, that's probably why — anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potter's for Sunday lunch, though.\" \"But . . . why did you . . . ?\" \"Leave?\" Sirius smiled bitterly and ran a hand through his long, unkempt hair. \"Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal . . . my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them . . . that's him.\" Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name regulus black. A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth. \"He was younger than me,\" said Sirius, \"and a much better son, as I was constantly reminded.\" \"But he died,\" said Harry. \"Yeah,\" said Sirius. \"Stupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters.\" \"You're kidding!\" \"Come on, Harry, haven't you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were?\" said Sirius testily. \"Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well?\" \"No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and having purebloods in charge. They weren't alone either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colors, who thought he had the right idea about things. . . . They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.\" \"Was he killed by an Auror?\" Harry asked tentatively. \"Oh no,\" said Sirius. \"No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemort's orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don't just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It's a lifetime of service or death.\" \"Lunch,\" said Mrs. Weasley's voice. She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in the face and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry. \"I haven't looked at this for years. There's Phineas Nigellus . . . my great-great-grandfather, see? Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had . . . and Araminta Meliflua . . . cousin of my mother's . . . tried to force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal . . . and dear Aunt Elladora . . . she started the family tradition of beheading house-elves when they got too old to carry tea trays . . . of course, anytime the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned. I see Tonks isn't on here. Maybe that's why Kreacher won't take orders from her — he's supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him. . . .\" \"You and Tonks are related?\" Harry asked, surprised. \"Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,\" said Sirius, examining the tapestry carefully. \"No, Andromeda's not on here either, look —\" He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa. \"Andromeda's sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggleborn, Ted Tonks, so —\" Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda's burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco. \"You're related to the Malfoys!\" \"The pure-blood families are all interrelated,\" said Sirius. \"If you're only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur's something like my second cousin once removed. But there's no point looking for them on here — if ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it's the Weasleys.\" But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda's burn: Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange. \"Lestrange . . .\" Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something in his memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he couldn't think where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach. \"They're in Azkaban,\" said Sirius shortly. Harry looked at him curiously. \"Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch, Junior,\" said Sirius in the same brusque voice. \"Rodolphus's brother, Rabastan, was with them too.\" And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledore's Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty. \"You never said she was your —\" \"Does it matter if she's my cousin?\" snapped Sirius. \"As far as I'm concerned, they're not my family. She's certainly not my family. I haven't seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming in to Azkaban. D'you think I'm proud of having relatives like her?\" \"Sorry,\" said Harry quickly, \"I didn't mean — I was just surprised, that's all —\" \"It doesn't matter, don't apologize,\" Sirius mumbled at once. He turned away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. \"I don't like being back here,\" he said, staring across the drawing room. \"I never thought I'd be stuck in this house again.\" Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel if forced, when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place forever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive. \"It's ideal for headquarters, of course,\" Sirius said. \"My father put every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived here. It's Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call — as if they'd have wanted to — and now Dumbledore's added his protection, you'd be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore's Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is — that note Moody showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore. . . .\" Sirius gave a short, barklike laugh. \"If my parents could see the use it was being put to now . . . well, my mother's portrait should give you some idea. . . .\" He scowled for a moment, then sighed. \"I wouldn't mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful. I've asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing — as Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral support, what d'you think?\" Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best, of hearing everything that was going on, it had completely flown his mind. At Sirius's words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him. \"Don't worry,\" Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius had been watching him. \"I'm sure they're going to clear you, there's definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.\" \"But if they do expel me,\" said Harry, quietly, \"can I come back here and live with you?\" Sirius smiled sadly. \"We'll see.\" \"I'd feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn't have to go back to the Dursleys,\" Harry pressed him. \"They must be bad if you prefer this place,\" said Sirius gloomily. \"Hurry up, you two, or there won't be any food left,\" Mrs. Weasley called. Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, and he and Harry went to join the others. Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds, his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove. \"It's okay,\" he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, \"must be Wartcap powder in there.\" He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already doxy-filled pocket. They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry's arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin; Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy locket that none of them could open, a number of ancient seals and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius's grandfather for \"Services to the Ministry.\" \"It means he gave them a load of gold,\" said Sirius contemptuously, throwing the medal into the rubbish sack. Several times, Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the Black crest from his grip Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never heard before. \"It was my father's,\" said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack. \"Kreacher wasn't quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught him snogging a pair of my father's old trousers last week.\" Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days. The drawing room took three days to decontaminate; finally the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the rattling writing desk; Moody had not dropped by headquarters yet, so they could not be sure what was inside it. They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders large as saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half). The china, which bore the Black crest and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them smashed. Snape might refer to their work as \"cleaning,\" but in Harry's opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said, \"Master must do as Master wishes,\" before turning away and muttering very loudly, \"but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum. . . .\" At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione's protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room. The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius's mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before Mrs. Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to Harry's relief they never came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though she also seemed too busy to linger. Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passersby. Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. Weasley's eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe. Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer. As long as he was busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry  hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled. The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not mentioning it. Sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys' . . . but he would not go. He was determined on that. He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius. He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs. Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, \"I've ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight too. A good first impression can work wonders.\" Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chops, but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew. \"How am I getting there?\" he asked Mrs. Weasley, trying to sound unconcerned. \"Arthur's taking you to work with him,\" said Mrs. Weasley gently. Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table. \"You can wait in my office until it's time for the hearing,\" he said. Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question, Mrs. Weasley had answered it. \"Professor Dumbledore doesn't think it's a good idea for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I —\" \"— think he's quite right,\" said Sirius through clenched teeth. Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips. \"When did Dumbledore tell you that?\" Harry said, staring at Sirius. \"He came last night, when you were in bed,\" said Mr. Weasley. Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry dropped his own eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if that were possible, even worse.\n",

      "quo;S REVENGE Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge's door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next. Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town. Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of'S REVENGE trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments, Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood. \"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!\" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent empty-handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors. \"I couldn't . . . make one,\" he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. \"Wouldn't . . . come.\" Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry's willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went. \"So we still haven't got any food.\" \"Shut up, Ron,\" snapped Hermione. \"Harry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn't make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!\" \"I don't know.\" He sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago: Today he might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express. Ron kicked a chair leg. \"What?\" he snarled at Hermione. \"I'm starving! All I've had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!\" \"You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,\" said Harry, stung. \"I would, but my arm's in a sling, in case you hadn't noticed!\" '\"That's convenient.\" \"And what's that supposed to — ?\" \"Of course!\" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence. \"Harry, give me the locket! Come on,\" she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not react, \"the Horcrux, Harry, you're still wearing it!\" She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The moment it parted contact with Harry's skin he felt free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted. \"Better?\" asked Hermione. \"Yeah, loads better!\" \"Harry,\" she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick, \"you don't think you've been possessed, do you?\" \"What? No!\" he said defensively. \"I remember everything we've done while I've been wearing it. I wouldn't know what I'd done if I'd been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn't remember anything.\" \"Hmm,\" said Hermione, looking down at the heavy gold locket. \"Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent.\"'S REVENGE \"We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,\" Harry stated firmly. \"If we lose it, if it gets stolen —\" \"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. \"But we'll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.\" \"Great,\" said Ron irritably, \"and now we've sorted that out, can we please get some food?\" \"Fine, but we'll go somewhere else to find it,\" said Hermione with half a glance at Harry. \"There's no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around.\" In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread. \"It's not stealing, is it?\" asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. \"Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?\" Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, \" 'Er-mynee, 'oo worry 'oo much. 'Elax!\" And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed: The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches. This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys'. Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron's turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant. \"So where next?\" was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they had already got, their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they had no new information. As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised; Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and Burkes, where he had worked after completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis of their speculations. \"Yeah, let's go to Albania. Shouldn't take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,\" said Ron sarcastically. \"There can't be anything there. He'd already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,\" said Hermione. \"We know the snake's not in Albania, it's usually with Vol —\" \"Didn't I ask you to stop saying that?\" \"Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who — happy?\" \"Not particularly.\" \"I can't see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes,\" said'S REVENGE Harry, who had made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. \"Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would've recognized a Horcrux straightaway.\" Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Harry plowed on, \"I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts.\" Hermione sighed. \"But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!\" Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory. \"Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwarts's secrets. I'm telling you, if there was one place Vol —\" \"Oi!\" \"YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!\" Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. \"If there was one place that was really important to YouKnow-Who, it was Hogwarts!\" \"Oh, come on,\" scoffed Ron. \"His school?\" \"Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left —\" \"This is You-Know-Who we're talking about, right? Not you?\" inquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him. \"You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left,\" said Hermione. \"That's right,\" said Harry. \"And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably another founder's object, to make into another Horcrux?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"But he didn't get the job, did he?\" said Hermione. \"So he never got the chance to find a founder's object there and hide it in the school!\" \"Okay, then,\" said Harry, defeated. \"Forget Hogwarts.\" Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before. They visited its site and found a tower block of offices. \"We could try digging in the foundations?\" Hermione suggested halfheartedly. \"He wouldn't have hidden a Horcrux here,\" Harry said. He had known it all along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, with its golden doors and marble floors. Even without any new ideas, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded'S REVENGE the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety. Harry's scar kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was wearing the Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain. \"What? What did you see?\" demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince. \"A face,\" muttered Harry, every time. \"The same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.\" And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry's scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes. As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water. Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it. Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it: They were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack of other people's company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort. \"My mother,\" said Ron one night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, \"can make good food appear out of thin air.\" He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. Harry glanced automatically at Ron's neck and saw, as he had expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket. \"Your mother can't produce food out of thin air,\" said Hermione. \"No one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfigur —\" \"Oh, speak English, can't you?\" Ron said, prising a fish bone out from between his teeth.'S REVENGE \"It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some —\" \"Well, don't bother increasing this, it's disgusting,\" said Ron. \"Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I'm always the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I'm a girl, I suppose!\" \"No, it's because you're supposed to be the best at magic!\" shot back Ron. Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor. \"You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I'll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you —\" \"Shut up!\" said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. \"Shut up now!\" Hermione looked outraged. \"How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook —\" \"Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!\" He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving. \"You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?\" he whispered to Hermione. \"I did everything,\" she whispered back, \"Muffliato, Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn't be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.\" Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, told them that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time. The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance. Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice. \"There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d'you reckon it's too early in the season? Accio Salmon!\" There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other. A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large shadows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking'S REVENGE salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again. \"Here, Griphook, Gornuk.\" Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. \"Thank you,\" said the goblins together in English. \"So, you three have been on the run how long?\" asked a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man. \"Six weeks . . . seven . . . I forget,\" said the tired man. \"Met up with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.\" There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. \"What made you leave, Ted?\" continued the man. \"Knew they were coming for me,\" replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who he was: Tonks's father. \"Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I'd better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I'd have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she's pure-blood. And then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?\" \"Yeah,\" said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor. \"Muggle-born, eh?\" asked the first man. \"Not sure,\" said Dean. \"My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I've got no proof he was a wizard, though.\" There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching; then Ted spoke again. \"I've got to say, Dirk, I'm surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was you'd been caught.\" \"I was,\" said Dirk. \"I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it, Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier than you'd think; I don't reckon he's quite right at the moment. Might be Confunded. If so, I'd like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.\" There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on. Then Ted said, \"And where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the whole.\" \"You had a false impression,\" said the higher-voiced of the goblins. \"We take no sides. This is a wizards' war.\" \"How come you're in hiding, then?\" \"I deemed it prudent,\" said the deeper-voiced goblin. \"Having refused what I considered an impertinent request, I could see that my personal safety was in jeopardy.\" \"What did they ask you to do?\" asked Ted. \"Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,\" replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less human as he said it. \"I am not a house-elf.\" \"What about you, Griphook?\" \"Similar reasons,\" said the higher-voiced goblin. \"Gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master.\" He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk laughed. \"What's the joke?\" asked Dean. \"He said,\" replied Dirk, \"that there are things wizards don't recognize, either.\"'S REVENGE There was a short pause. \"I don't get it,\" said Dean. \"I had my small revenge before I left,\" said Griphook in English. \"Good man — goblin, I should say,\" amended Ted hastily. \"Didn't manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?\" \"If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,\" replied Griphook. Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle. \"Dean and I are still missing something here,\" said Ted. \"So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,\" said Griphook, and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry's breathing was shallow with excitement: He and Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could. \"Didn't you hear about that, Ted?\" asked Dirk. \"About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor's sword out of Snape's office at Hogwarts?\" An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot. \"Never heard a word,\" said Ted. \"Not in the Prophet, was it?\" \"Hardly,\" chortled Dirk. \"Griphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill's younger sister.\" Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines. \"She and a couple of friends got into Snape's office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase.\" \"Ah, God bless 'em,\" said Ted. \"What did they think, that they'd be able to use the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself?\" \"Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn't safe where it was,\" said Dirk. \"Couple of days later, once he'd got the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.\" The goblins started to laugh again. \"I'm still not seeing the joke,\" said Ted. \"It's a fake,\" rasped Griphook. \"The sword of Gryffindor!\" \"Oh yes. It is a copy — an excellent copy, it is true — but it was Wizard-made. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank.\" \"I see,\" said Ted. \"And I take it you didn't bother telling the Death Eaters this?\" \"I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,\" said Griphook smugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk's laughter. Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question he needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged; he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of Ginny's too. \"What happened to Ginny and the others? The ones who tried to steal it?\" \"Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,\" said Griphook indifferently.'S REVENGE \"They're okay, though?\" asked Ted quickly. \"I mean, the Weasleys don't need any more of their kids injured, do they?\" \"They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,\" said Griphook. \"Lucky for them,\" said Ted. \"With Snape's track record I suppose we should just be glad they're still alive.\" \"You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?\" asked Dirk. \"You believe Snape killed Dumbledore?\" \" 'Course I do,\" said Ted. \"You're not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it?\" \"Hard to know what to believe these days,\" muttered Dirk. \"I know Harry Potter,\" said Dean. \"And I reckon he's the real thing — the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.\" \"Yeah, there's a lot would like to believe he's that, son,\" said Dirk, \"me included. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You'd think, if he knew anything we don't, or had anything special going for him, he'd be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against him —\" \"The Prophet?\" scoffed Ted. \"You deserve to be lied to if you're still reading that muck, Dirk. You want the facts, try the Quibbler.\" There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal of thumping; by the sound of it, Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he spluttered, \"The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegood's?\" \"It's not so lunatic these days,\" said Ted. \"You want to give it a look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet's ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. How long they'll let him get away with it, mind, I don't know. But Xeno says, front page of every issue, that any wizard who's against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-one priority.\" \"Hard to help a boy who's vanished off the face of the earth,\" said Dirk. \"Listen, the fact that they haven't caught him yet's one hell of an achievement,\" said Ted. \"I'd take tips from him gladly; it's what we're trying to do, stay free, isn't it?\" \"Yeah, well, you've got a point there,\" said Dirk heavily. \"With the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him I'd have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who's to say they haven't already caught and killed him without publicizing it?\" \"Ah, don't say that, Dirk,\" murmured Ted. There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away. Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more than, \"Ginny — the sword —\" \"I know!\" said Hermione. She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit. \"Here . . . we . . . are . . .\" she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas'S REVENGE Nigellus free of Hermione's bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment. \"If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledore's office,\" she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, \"Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!\" \"Unless he was asleep,\" said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said: \"Er — Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?\" Nothing happened. \"Phineas Nigellus?\" said Hermione again. \"Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? Please?\" \" 'Please' always helps,\" said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried: \"Obscuro!\" A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus's clever, dark eyes, causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain. \"What — how dare — what are you — ?\" \"I'm very sorry, Professor Black,\" said Hermione, \"but it's a necessary precaution!\" \"Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?\" \"Never mind where we are,\" said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold. \"Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?\" \"Maybe,\" said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus's interest. \"We've got a couple of questions to ask you — about the sword of Gryffindor.\" \"Ah,\" said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of Harry, \"yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there —\" \"Shut up about my sister,\" said Ron roughly. Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows. \"Who else is here?\" he asked, turning his head from side to side. \"Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster!\" \"They weren't thieving,\" said Harry. \"That sword isn't Snape's.\" \"It belongs to Professor Snape's school,\" said Phineas Nigellus. \"Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!\" \"Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!\" said Hermione. \"Where am I?\" repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. \"Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?\" \"Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?\" asked Harry urgently. \"Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.\" \"Hagrid's not an oaf!\" said Hermione shrilly. \"And Snape might've thought that was a punishment,\" said Harry, \"but Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . they've faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!\" He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at the very least.'S REVENGE \"What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, taken out the sword at all? Maybe it's been taken away for cleaning or — or something?\" Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered. \"Muggle-borns,\" he said. \"Goblin-made armor does not require cleaning, simple girl. Goblins' silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.\" \"Don't call Hermione simple,\" said Harry. \"I grow weary of contradiction,\" said Phineas Nigellus. \"Perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmaster's office?\" Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration. \"Dumbledore! Can't you bring us Dumbledore?\" \"I beg your pardon?\" asked Phineas Nigellus. \"Professor Dumbledore's portrait — couldn't you bring him along, here, into yours?\" Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry's voice. \"Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside the castle except to visit a painting of themselves hanging elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me, and after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure you that I shall not be making a return visit!\" Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame. \"Professor Black,\" said Hermione, \"couldn't you just tell us, please, when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean?\" Phineas snorted impatiently. \"I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.\" Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at last managed to locate the exit. \"Well, good night to you,\" he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout. \"Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?\" Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture. \"Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!\" And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop. \"Harry!\" Hermione cried. \"I know!\" Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus's portrait back into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry. \"The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthen them — Harry, that sword's impregnated with basilisk venom!\"'S REVENGE \"And Dumbledore didn't give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket —\" \"— and he must have realized they wouldn't let you have it if he put it in his will —\" \"— so he made a copy —\" \"— and put a fake in the glass case —\" \"— and he left the real one — where?\" They gazed at each other; Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn't Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not realized it at the time? \"Think!\" whispered Hermione. \"Think! Where would he have left it?\" \"Not at Hogwarts,\" said Harry, resuming his pacing. \"Somewhere in Hogsmeade?\" suggested Hermione. \"The Shrieking Shack?\" said Harry. \"Nobody ever goes in there.\" \"But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn't that be a bit risky?\" \"Dumbledore trusted Snape,\" Harry reminded her. \"Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,\" said Hermione. \"Yeah, you're right!\" said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the thought that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however faint, about Snape's trustworthiness. \"So, would he have hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d'you reckon, Ron? Ron?\" Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk, looking stony. \"Oh, remembered me, have you?\" he said. \"What?\" Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk. \"You two carry on. Don't let me spoil your fun.\" Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, apparently as nonplussed as he was. \"What's the problem?\" asked Harry. \"Problem? There's no problem,\" said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. \"Not according to you, anyway.\" There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain. \"Well, you've obviously got a problem,\" said Harry. \"Spit it out, will you?\" Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike himself. \"All right, I'll spit it out. Don't expect me to skip up and down the tent because there's some other damn thing we've got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you don't know.\" \"I don't know?\" repeated Harry, \"I don't know?\" Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry's jubilation: Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking. \"It's not like I'm not having the time of my life here,\" said Ron, \"you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we'd been running round a few weeks, we'd have achieved something.\"'S REVENGE \"Ron,\" Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now beating on the tent. \"I thought you knew what you'd signed up for,\" said Harry. \"Yeah, I thought I did too.\" \"So what part of it isn't living up to your expectations?\" asked Harry. Anger was coming to his defense now. \"Did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you'd be back to Mummy by Christmas?\" \"We thought you knew what you were doing!\" shouted Ron, standing up, and his words pierced Harry like scalding knives. \"We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!\" \"Ron!\" said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her. \"Well, sorry to let you down,\" said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, inadequate. \"I've been straight with you from the start, I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven't noticed, we've found one Horcrux —\" \"Yeah, and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!\" \"Take off the locket, Ron,\" Hermione said, her voice unusually high. \"Please take it off. You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day.\" \"Yeah, he would,\" said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. \"D'you think I haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D'you think I didn't guess you were thinking this stuff?\" \"Harry, we weren't —\" \"Don't lie!\" Ron hurled at her. \"You said it too, you said you were disappointed, you said you'd thought he had a bit more to go on than —\" \"I didn't say it like that — Harry, I didn't!\" she cried. The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione's face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they knew not where, and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be dead. \"So why are you still here?\" Harry asked Ron. \"Search me,\" said Ron. \"Go home then,\" said Harry. \"Yeah, maybe I will!\" shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. \"Didn't you hear what they said about my sister? But you don't give a rat's fart, do you, it's only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I've-Faced-Worse Potter doesn't care what happens to her in here — well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff —\" \"I was only saying — she was with the others, they were with Hagrid —\" \"Yeah, I get it, you don't care! And what about the rest of my family, 'the Weasleys don't need another kid injured,' did you hear that?\" \"Yeah, I —\" \"Not bothered what it meant, though?\" \"Ron!\" said Hermione, forcing her way between them. \"I don't think it means anything new has happened, anything we don't know about; think, Ron, Bill's already scarred, plenty of people'S REVENGE must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you're supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I'm sure that's all he meant —\" \"Oh, you're sure, are you? Right then, well, I won't bother myself about them. It's all right for you two, isn't it, with your parents safely out of the way —\" \"My parents are dead!\" Harry bellowed. \"And mine could be going the same way!\" yelled Ron. \"Then GO!\" roared Harry. \"Go back to them, pretend you've got over your spattergroit and Mummy'll be able to feed you up and —\" Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner's pocket, Hermione had raised her own. \"Protego!\" she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron: Something had broken between them. \"Leave the Horcrux,\" Harry said. Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to Hermione. \"What are you doing?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Are you staying, or what?\" \"I . . .\" She looked anguished. \"Yes — yes, I'm staying. Ron, we said we'd go with Harry, we said we'd help —\" \"I get it. You choose him.\" \"Ron, no — please — come back, come back!\" She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed it he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron's name amongst the trees. After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face. \"He's g-g-gone! Disapparated!\" She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry. Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron's bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.\n",

      "quo;S TALE Harry sprinted up to the boys' dormitory to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map from his trunk; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls' dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats. \"Well, it's cold out there!\" she said defensively, as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently. They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the cloak — Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing — then, moving slowly and cautiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Norris. They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like \"Weasley Is Our King.\" They crept across the entrance hall and then out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid's chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two'S TALE jostling and bumping along behind him, and they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door; when Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside. \"Hagrid, it's us!\" Harry called through the keyhole. \"Shoulda known!\" said a gruff voice. They beamed at one another under the cloak; they could tell that Hagrid's voice was pleased. \"Bin home three seconds . . . Out the way, Fang . . . Out the way, yeh dozy dog . . .\" The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open, and Hagrid's head appeared in the gap. Hermione screamed. \"Merlin's beard, keep it down!\" said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. \"Under that cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!\" \"I'm sorry!\" Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them. \"I just — oh, Hagrid !\" \"It's nuthin', it's nuthin'!\" said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror. Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood, and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple-and-black bruises. There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleeding, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home; a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man and three times as broad, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it. \"What happened to you?\" Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick their faces. \"Told yeh, nuthin',\" said Hagrid firmly. \"Want a cuppa?\" \"Come off it,\" said Ron, \"you're in a right state!\" \"I'm tellin' yeh, I'm fine,\" said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing. \"Blimey, it's good ter see you three again — had good summers, did yeh?\" \"Hagrid, you've been attacked!\" said Ron. \"Fer the las' time, it's nuthin'!\" said Hagrid firmly. \"Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?\" Ron demanded. \"You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,\" said Hermione anxiously. \"Some of those cuts look nasty.\" \"I'm dealin' with it, all righ'?\" said Hagrid repressively. He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire. \"You're not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?\" said Ron, leaning in for a closer look. \"It looks poisonous.\" \"It's s'posed ter look like that, it's dragon meat,\" Hagrid said. \"An' I didn' get it ter eat.\" He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face. Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction. \"Tha's better. It helps with the stingin', yeh know.\" \"So are you going to tell us what's happened to you?\" Harry asked. \"Can', Harry. Top secret. More'n me job's worth ter tell yeh that.\" \"Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione quietly. Hagrid's fingers slipped on the dragon steak, and it slid squelchily onto his chest. \"Giants?\" said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face. \"Who said anythin' abou' giants? 'S TALE Who yeh bin talkin' to? Who's told yeh what I've — who's said I've bin — eh?\" \"We guessed,\" said Hermione apologetically. \"Oh, yeh did, did yeh?\" said Hagrid, fixing her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak. \"It was kind of . . . obvious,\" said Ron. Harry nodded. Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak onto the table again and strode back to the kettle, which was now whistling. \"Never known kids like you three fer knowin' more'n yeh oughta,\" he muttered, splashing boiling water into three of his bucket-shaped mugs. \"An' I'm not complimentin' yeh, neither. Nosy, some'd call it. Interferin'.\" But his beard twitched. \"So you have been to look for giants?\" said Harry, grinning as he sat down at the table. Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his steak again, and slapped it back over his face. \"Yeah, all righ',\" he grunted, \"I have.\" \"And you found them?\" said Hermione in a hushed voice. \"Well, they're not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,\" said Hagrid. \"Pretty big, see.\" \"Where are they?\" said Ron. \"Mountains,\" said Hagrid unhelpfully. \"So why don't Muggles — ?\" \"They do,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"O'ny their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin' accidents, aren' they?\" He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising. \"Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you've been up to!\" said Ron. \"Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors —\" Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea, and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft splat, onto the floor. \"Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?\" growled Hagrid. \"Didn't you know?\" Hermione asked him, wide-eyed. \"I don' know anything that's been happenin' since I left. I was on a secret mission, wasn' I, didn' wan' owls followin' me all over the place — ruddy dementors! Yeh're not serious?\" \"Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me —\" \"WHAT?\" \"— and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first.\" \"You were expelled?\" \"Tell us about your summer and I'll tell you about mine.\" Hagrid glared at him through his one open eye. Harry looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on his face. \"Oh, all righ',\" Hagrid said in a resigned voice. He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang's mouth. \"Oh, Hagrid, don't, it's not hygien —\" Hermione began, but Ha-grid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye. He took another fortifying gulp of tea and then said, \"Well, we set off righ' after term ended —\" \"Madame Maxime went with you, then?\" Hermione interjected. \"Yeah, tha's right,\" said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak. \"Yeah, it was jus' the pair of us. An' I'll tell yeh this, she's not afraid of roughin' it, Olympe. Yeh know, she's a fine, well-dressed woman, an' knowin' where we was goin' I wondered 'ow she'd feel abou' clamberin' over boulders an' sleepin' in caves an' tha', bu' she never complained once.\"'S TALE \"You knew where you were going?\" Harry asked. \"You knew where the giants were?\" \"Well, Dumbledore knew, an' he told us,\" said Hagrid. \"Are they hidden?\" asked Ron. \"Is it a secret, where they are?\" \"Not really,\" said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head. \"It's jus' that mos' wizards aren' bothered where they are, s' long as it's a good long way away. But where they are's very difficult ter get ter, fer humans anyway, so we needed Dumbledore's instructions. Took us abou' a month ter get there —\" \"A month?\" said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time. \"But — why couldn't you just grab a Portkey or something?\" There was an odd expression in Hagrid's unobscured eye as he squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying. \"We're bein' watched, Ron,\" he said gruffly. \"What d'you mean?\" \"Yeh don' understand,\" said Hagrid. \"The Ministry's keepin' an eye on Dumbledore an' anyone they reckon's in league with him, an' —\" \"We know about that,\" said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest of Hagrid's story. \"We know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore —\" \"So you couldn't use magic to get there?\" asked Ron, looking thunderstruck. \"You had to act like Muggles all the way?\" \"Well, not exactly all the way,\" said Hagrid cagily. \"We jus' had ter be careful, 'cause Olympe an' me, we stick out a bit —\" Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea. \"— so we're not hard ter follow. We was pretendin' we was goin' on holiday together, so we got inter France an' we made like we was headin' fer where Olympe's school is, 'cause we knew we was bein' tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, 'cause I'm not really s'posed ter use magic an' we knew the Ministry'd be lookin' fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin' us the slip round abou' Dee-John —\" \"Ooooh, Dijon?\" said Hermione excitedly. \"I've been there on holiday, did you see — ?\" She fell silent at the look on Ron's face. \"We chanced a bit o' magic after that, and it wasn' a bad journey. Ran inter a couple o' mad trolls on the Polish border, an' I had a sligh' disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha', couldn't'a bin smoother. \"An' then we reached the place, an' we started trekkin' up through the mountains, lookin' fer signs of 'em . . . \"We had ter lay off the magic once we got near 'em. Partly 'cause they don' like wizards an' we didn' want ter put their backs up too soon, and partly 'cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an' all. Said it was odds on he'd sent a messenger off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin' attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.\" Hagrid paused for a long draft of tea. \"Go on!\" said Harry urgently. \"Found 'em,\" said Hagrid baldly. \"Went over a ridge one nigh' an' there they was, spread ou' underneath us. Little fires burnin' below an' huge shadows . . . It was like watchin' bits o' the mountain movin'.\" \"How big are they?\" asked Ron in a hushed voice. \" 'Bout twenty feet,\" said Hagrid casually. \"Some o' the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.\" \"And how many were there?\" asked Harry. \"I reckon abou' seventy or eighty,\" said Hagrid. \"Is that all?\" said Hermione. \"Yep,\" said Hagrid sadly, \"eighty left, an' there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff'rent tribes from all over the world. But they've bin dyin' out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o' course, but 'S TALE mostly they killed each other, an' now they're dyin' out faster than ever. They're not made ter live bunched up together like tha'. Dumbledore says it's our fault, it was the wizards who forced 'em to go an' made 'em live a good long way from us an' they had no choice but ter stick together fer their own protection.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"you saw them and then what?\" \"Well, we waited till morning, didn' want ter go sneakin' up on 'em in the dark, fer our own safety,\" said Hagrid. \" 'Bout three in the mornin' they fell asleep jus' where they was sittin'. We didn' dare sleep. Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of 'em woke up an' came up where we were, an' fer another, the snorin' was unbelievable. Caused an avalanche near mornin'. \"Anyway, once it was light we wen' down ter see 'em.\" \"Just like that?\" said Ron, looking awestruck. \"You just walked right into a giant camp?\" \"Well, Dumbledore'd told us how ter do it,\" said Hagrid. \"Give the Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.\" \"Give the what gifts?\" asked Harry. \"Oh, the Gurg — means the chief.\" \"How could you tell which one was the Gurg?\" asked Ron. Hagrid grunted in amusement. \"No problem,\" he said. \"He was the biggest, the ugliest, an' the laziest. Sittin' there waitin' ter be brought food by the others. Dead goats an' such like. Name o' Karkus. I'd put him at twenty-two, twenty-three feet, an' the weight of a couple o' bull elephants. Skin like rhino hide an' all.\" \"And you just walked up to him?\" said Hermione breathlessly. \"Well . . . down ter him, where he was lyin' in the valley. They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an' Karkus was lyin' by the lake roarin' at the others ter feed him an' his wife. Olympe an' I went down the mountainside —\" \"But didn't they try and kill you when they saw you?\" asked Ron incredulously. \"It was def'nitely on some of their minds,\" said Hagrid, shrugging, \"but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an' keep our eyes on the Gurg an' ignore the others. So tha's what we did. An' the rest of 'em went quiet an' watched us pass an' we got right up ter Karkus's feet an' we bowed an' put our present down in front o' him.\" \"What do you give a giant?\" asked Ron eagerly. \"Food?\" \"Nah, he can get food all righ' fer himself,\" said Hagrid. \"We took him magic. Giants like magic, jus' don't like us usin' it against 'em. Anyway, that firs' day we gave him a branch o' Gubraithian fire.\" Hermione said \"wow\" softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement. \"A branch of — ?\" \"Everlasting fire,\" said Hermione irritably, \"you ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick's mentioned it at least twice in class!\" \"Well anyway,\" said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, \"Dumbledore'd bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn' somethin' any wizard could do, an' so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus's feet and says, 'A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.' \" \"And what did Karkus say?\" asked Harry eagerly. \"Nothin',\" said Hagrid. \"Didn' speak English.\" \"You're kidding!\" \"Didn' matter,\" said Hagrid imperturbably, \"Dumbledore had warned us tha' migh' happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o' giants who knew our lingo an' they translated fer us.\" \"And did he like the present?\" asked Ron. \"Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,\" said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler'S TALE side to his swollen eye. \"Very pleased. So then I said, 'Albus Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift.' \" \"Why couldn't you speak to them that day?\" asked Hermione. \"Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,\" said Hagrid. \"Let 'em see we kept our promises. We'll come back tomorrow with another present, an' then we do come back with another present — gives a good impression, see? An' gives them time ter test out the firs' present an' find out it's a good one, an' get 'em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus — overload 'em with information an' they'll kill yeh jus' to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an' went off an' found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in, an' the followin' mornin' we went back an' this time we found Karkus sittin' up waitin' fer us lookin' all eager.\" \"And you talked to him?\" \"Oh yeah. Firs' we presented him with a nice battle helmet — goblin-made an' indestructible, yeh know — an' then we sat down an' we talked.\" \"What did he say?\" \"Not much,\" said Hagrid. \"Listened mostly. But there were good signs. He'd heard o' Dumbledore, heard he'd argued against the killin' of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int'rested in what Dumbledore had ter say. An' a few o' the others, 'specially the ones who had some English, they gathered round an' listened too. We were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next day with another present. \"But that night it all wen' wrong.\" \"What d'you mean?\" said Ron quickly. \"Well, like I say, they're not meant ter live together, giants,\" said Hagrid sadly. \"Not in big groups like that. They can' help themselves, they half kill each other every few weeks. The men fight each other an'  the women fight each other, the remnants of the old tribes fight each other, an' that's even without squabbles over food an' the best fires an' sleepin' spots. Yeh'd think, seein' as how their whole race is abou' finished, they'd lay off each other, but . . .\" Hagrid sighed deeply \"That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin' down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn' believe the noise. An' when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an' his head was lyin' at the bottom o' the lake.\" \"Whose head?\" gasped Hermione. \"Karkus's,\" said Hagrid heavily. \"There was a new Gurg, Golgomath.\" He sighed deeply. \"Well, we hadn' bargained on a new Gurg two days after we'd made friendly contact with the firs' one, an' we had a funny feelin' Golgomath wouldn' be so keen ter listen to us, but we had ter try.\" \"You went to speak to him?\" asked Ron incredulously. \"After you'd watched him rip off another giant's head?\" \" 'Course we did,\" said Hagrid, \"we hadn' gone all that way ter give up after two days! We wen' down with the next present we'd meant ter give ter Karkus. \"I knew it was no go before I'd opened me mouth. He was sitting there wearin' Karkus's helmet, leerin' at us as we got nearer. He's massive, one o' the biggest ones there. Black hair an' matchin' teeth an' a necklace o' bones. Human-lookin' bones, some of 'em. Well, I gave it a go — held out a great roll o' dragon skin — an' said A gift fer the Gurg of the giants —' Nex' thing I knew, I was hangin' upside down in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me.\" Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth. \"How did you get out of that?\" asked Harry. \"Wouldn'ta done if Olympe hadn' bin there,\" said Hagrid. \"She pulled out her wand an' did some o' the fastes' spellwork I've ever seen.'S TALE Ruddy marvelous. Hit the two holdin' me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an' they dropped me straightaway — bu' we were in trouble then, 'cause we'd used magic against 'em, an' that's what giants hate abou' wizards. We had ter leg it an' we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again.\" \"Blimey, Hagrid,\" said Ron quietly. \"So how come it's taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?\" asked Hermione. \"We didn' leave after three days!\" said Hagrid, looking outraged. \"Dumbledore was relyin' on us!\" \"But you've just said there was no way you could go back!\" \"Not by daylight, we couldn', no. We just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o' days lyin' low up in the cave an' watchin'. An' wha' we saw wasn' good.\" \"Did he rip off more heads?\" asked Hermione, sounding squeamish. \"No,\" said Hagrid. \"I wish he had.\" \"What d'you mean?\" \"I mean we soon found out he didn' object ter all wizards — just us.\" \"Death Eaters?\" said Harry quickly. \"Yep,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"Couple of 'em were visitin' him ev'ry day, bringin' gifts ter the Gurg, an' he wasn' dangling them upside down.\" \"How d'you know they were Death Eaters?\" said Ron. \"Because I recognized one of 'em,\" Hagrid growled. \"Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes killin' as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin' on so well.\" \"So Macnair's persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?\" said Hermione desperately. \"Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven' finished me story yet!\" said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. \"Me  an' Olympe talked it over an' we agreed, jus' 'cause the Gurg looked like favorin' You-Know-Who didn' mean all of 'em would. We had ter try an' persuade some o' the others, the ones who hadn' wanted Golgomath as Gurg.\" \"How could you tell which ones they were?\" asked Ron. \"Well, they were the ones bein' beaten to a pulp, weren' they?\" said Hagrid patiently. \"The ones with any sense were keepin' outta Golgomath's way, hidin' out in caves roun' the gully jus' like we were. So we decided we'd go pokin' round the caves by night an' see if we couldn' persuade a few o' them.\" \"You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?\" said Ron with awed respect in his voice. \"Well, it wasn' the giants who worried us most,\" said Hagrid. \"We were more concerned abou' the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us before we wen' not ter tangle with 'em if we could avoid it, an' the trouble was they knew we was around — 'spect Golgomath told him abou' us. At night when the giants were sleepin' an' we wanted ter be creepin' inter the caves, Macnair an' the other one were sneakin' round the mountains lookin' fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin' out at them,\" said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard. \"She was rarin' ter attack 'em. . . . she's somethin' when she's roused, Olympe. . . . Fiery, yeh know . . . 'spect it's the French in her . . .\" Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty seconds' reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly. \"So what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?\" \"What? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin' in and headed back down inter the gully, keepin' our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o' the caves, no go — then, in abou' the sixth one, we found three giants hidin'.\" \"Cave must've been cramped,\" said Ron.'S TALE \"Wasn' room ter swing a kneazle,\" said Hagrid. \"Didn't they attack you when they saw you?\" asked Hermione. \"Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,\" said Ha-grid, \"but they was badly hurt, all three o' them. Golgomath's lot had beaten 'em unconscious; they'd woken up an' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o' them had a bit of English an' 'e translated fer the others, an' what we had ter say didn' seem ter go down too badly. So we kep' goin' back, visitin' the wounded. . . . I reckon we had abou' six or seven o' them convinced at one poin'.\" \"Six or seven?\" said Ron eagerly. \"Well that's not bad — are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?\" But Hermione said, \"What do you mean 'at one point,' Hagrid?\" Hagrid looked at her sadly. \"Golgomath's lot raided the caves. The ones tha' survived didn' wan' no more ter to do with us after that.\" \"So . . . so there aren't any giants coming?\" said Ron, looking disappointed. \"Nope,\" said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak again and applied the cooler side to his face, \"but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave 'em Dumbledore's message an' some o' them heard it an' I 'spect some o' them'll remember it. Jus' maybe, them that don' want ter stay around Golgomath'll move outta the mountains, an' there's gotta be a chance they'll remember Dumbledore's friendly to 'em. . . . Could be they'll come . . .\" Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap. \"Hagrid?\" said Hermione quietly after a while. \"Mmm?\" \"Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything about your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?\" Hagrid's unobscured eye rested upon her, and Hermione looked rather scared. \"I'm sorry . . . I . . . forget it —\" \"Dead,\" Hagrid grunted. \"Died years ago. They told me.\" \"Oh . . . I'm . . . I'm really sorry,\" said Hermione in a very small voice. Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. \"No need,\" he said shortly. \"Can' remember her much. Wasn' a great mother.\" They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak. \"But you still haven't explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,\" Ron said, gesturing toward Hagrid's bloodstained face. \"Or why you're back so late,\" said Harry. \"Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago —\" \"Who attacked you?\" said Ron. \"I haven' bin attacked!\" said Hagrid emphatically. \"I —\" But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain. \"It's her!\" Ron whispered. \"Get under here!\" Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived beneath the cloak as well. Huddled together they backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Ha-grid looked thoroughly confused. \"Hagrid, hide our mugs!\" Hagrid seized Harry's and Ron's mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang's basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open. Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her'S TALE green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to see Hagrid's face; she barely reached his navel. \"So,\" she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. \"You're Hagrid, are you?\" Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her bulging eyes rolling in every direction. \"Get away,\" she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face. \"Er — I don' want ter be rude,\" said Hagrid, staring at her, \"but who the ruddy hell are you?\" \"My name is Dolores Umbridge.\" Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione. \"Dolores Umbridge?\" Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. \"I thought you were one o' them Ministry — don' you work with Fudge?\" \"I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,\" said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak. \"I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher —\" \"Tha's brave of yeh,\" said Hagrid, \"there's not many'd take tha' job anymore —\" \"— and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,\" said Umbridge, giving no sign that she had heard him. \"Wha's that?\" said Hagrid, frowning. \"Precisely what I was going to ask,\" said Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione's mug. \"Oh,\" said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood hidden, \"oh, tha' was . . . was Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.\" Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabin's. \"I heard voices,\" she said quietly. \"I was talkin' ter Fang,\" said Hagrid stoutly. \"And was he talking back to you?\" \"Well . . . in a manner o' speakin',\" said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable. \"I sometimes say Fang's near enough human —\" \"There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,\" said Umbridge sleekly. Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth. Luckily, Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge's robes, and she did not appear to have heard. \"Well, I on'y jus' got back,\" said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack. \"Maybe someone came ter call earlier an' I missed em. \"There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.\" \"Well I . . . I don' know why that'd be. . . .\" said Hagrid, tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood, as though asking for help. \"Erm . . .\" Umbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin, looking around carefully. She bent and peered under the bed. She opened Hagrid's cupboards. She passed within two inches of where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled around again and said, \"What has happened to you? How did you sustain those injuries?\" Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in Harry's opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising 'S TALE all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. \"Oh, I . . . had a bit of an accident,\" he said lamely. \"What sort of accident?\" \"I-I tripped.\" \"You tripped,\" she repeated coolly. \"Yeah, tha's right. Over . . . over a friends broomstick. I don' fly, meself. Well, look at the size o' me, I don' reckon there's a broomstick that'd hold me. Friend o' mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if you've ever seen 'em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, I've had a bit of a ride on one o' them an' it was —\" \"Where have you been?\" asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through Hagrid's babbling. \"Where've I . . . ?\" \"Been, yes,\" she said. \"Term started more than two months ago. Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You left no address. Where have you been?\" There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye. Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously. \"I — I've been away for me health,\" he said. \"For your health,\" said Umbridge. Her eyes traveled over Hagrid's discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto his waistcoat in the silence. \"I see.\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"bit o' — o' fresh air, yeh know —\" \"Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,\" said Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid's face that was not black or purple flushed. \"Well — change o' scene, yeh know —\" \"Mountain scenery?\" said Umbridge swiftly. She knows, Harry thought desperately. \"Mountains?\" Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. \"Nope, South of France fer me. Bit o' sun an' . . . an' sea.\" \"Really?\" said Umbridge. \"You don't have much of a tan.\" \"Yeah . . . well . . . sensitive skin,\" said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out. Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered. Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, \"I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.\" \"Righ',\" said Hagrid, nodding. \"You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough.\" She turned sharply and marched back to the door. \"You're inspectin' us?\" Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after her. \"Oh yes,\" said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle. \"The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Good night.\" She left, closing the door behind her with a snap. Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist. \"Not yet,\" she breathed in his ear. \"She might not be gone yet.\" Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so. \"She's goin' back ter the castle,\" he said in a low voice. \"Blimey . . . inspectin' people, is she?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, pulling the cloak off. \"Trelawney's on probation already. . . .\" \"Um . . . what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione. \"Oh, don' you worry abou' that, I've got a great load o' lessons planned,\" said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again. \"I've bin keepin' a'S TALE couple o' creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they're some-thin' really special.\" \"Erm . . . special in what way?\" asked Hermione tentatively. \"I'm not sayin',\" said Hagrid happily. \"I don' want ter spoil the surprise.\" \"Look, Hagrid,\" said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense, \"Professor Umbridge won't be at all happy if you bring anything to class that's too dangerous —\" \"Dangerous?\" said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. \"Don' be silly, I wouldn' give yeh anythin' dangerous! I mean, all righ', they can look after themselves —\" \"Hagrid, you've got to pass Umbridge's inspection, and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like that!\" said Hermione earnestly. \"But tha's not very interestin', Hermione,\" said Hagrid. \"The stuff I've got's much more impressive, I've bin bringin' 'em on fer years, I reckon I've got the on'y domestic herd in Britain —\" \"Hagrid . . . please . . .\" said Hermione, a note of real desperation in her voice. \"Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull that's bound to come up in our O.W.L. . . .\" But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing toward the vast bed in the corner. \"Lis'en, it's bin a long day an' it's late,\" he said, patting Hermione gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud. \"Oh — sorry —\" He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes. \"Look, don' you go worryin' abou' me, I promise yeh I've got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I'm back. . . . Now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an' don' forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!\" \"I dunno if you got through to him,\" said Ron a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went. \"Then I'll go back again tomorrow,\" said Hermione determinedly. \"I'll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don't care if she throws out Trelawney but she's not taking Hagrid!\"\n",

      "Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts. Ginny gave a gasp of horror. \"To me, Potter,\" repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up. Harry's insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped and outnumbered two to one. \"To me,\" said Malfoy yet again. \"Where's Sirius?\" Harry said. Several of the Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry's left said triumphantly, \"The Dark Lord always knows!\" \"Always,\" echoed Malfoy softly. \"Now, give me the prophecy, Potter.\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" mimicked the woman to his left. She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were &bull; 781 &bull; CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry's eyes. \"You've got him,\" said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row. \"He's here. I know he is.\" \"The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo,\" said the woman in a horrible, mock-baby voice. Harry felt Ron stir beside him. \"Don't do anything,\" he muttered. \"Not yet —\" The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter. \"You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!\" \"Oh, you don't know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,\" said Malfoy softly. \"He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.\" \"I know Sirius is here,\" said Harry, though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly. \"I know you've got him!\" More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman still laughed loudest of all. \"It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.\" \"Go on, then,\" said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry's stomach tightened. If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all. . . . But the Death Eaters did not strike. \"Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,\" said Malfoy coolly. It was Harry's turn to laugh. \"Yeah, right!\" he said. \"I give you this — prophecy, is it? And you'll just let us skip off home, will you?\" The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked, \"Accio Proph —\" Harry was just ready for her. He shouted \"Protego!\" before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it. \"Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,\" she said, her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. \"Very well, then —\" \"I TOLD YOU, NO!\" Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. \"If you smash it — !\" Harry's mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get them all out of this alive, make sure that none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity . . . The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow. \"You need more persuasion?\" she said, her chest rising and falling rapidly. \"Very well — take the smallest one,\" she ordered the Death Eaters beside her. \"Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I'll do it.\" Harry felt the others close in around Ginny. He stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest. \"You'll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,\" he told Bellatrix. \"I don't think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he?\" She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth. \"So,\" said Harry, \"what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway?\"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville's arm was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking. He could feel one of the other's quickened breath on the back of his head. He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his mind was blank. \"What kind of prophecy?\" repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from her face. \"You jest, Harry Potter.\" \"Nope, not jesting,\" said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape. \"How come Voldemort wants it?\" Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses. \"You dare speak his name?\" whispered Bellatrix. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. \"Yeah, I've got no problem saying Vol —\" \"Shut your mouth!\" Bellatrix shrieked. \"You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood's tongue, you dare —\" \"Did you know he's a half-blood too?\" said Harry recklessly. Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. \"Voldemort? Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle — or has he been telling you lot he's pureblood?\" \"STUPEF —\" \"NO!\" A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange's wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. His spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered. Two figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak. Their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments  of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix's shouts. \". . . at the Solstice will come a new . . .\" said the figure of an old, bearded man. \"DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!\" \"He dared — he dares —\" shrieked Bellatrix incoherently. \"— He stands there — filthy half-blood —\" \"WAIT UNTIL WE'VE GOT THE PROPHECY!\" bawled Malfoy. \". . . and none will come after . . .\" said the figure of a young woman. The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however, given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the others. \"You haven't told me what's so special about this prophecy I'm supposed to be handing over,\" he said, playing for time. He moved his foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else's. \"Do not play games with us, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"I'm not playing games,\" said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone's toes and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermione's. \"What?\" she whispered. \"Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?\" said Malfoy sneeringly. \"I — what?\" said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan. \"What about my scar?\" \"What?\" whispered Hermione more urgently behind him. \"Can this be?\" said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of theirCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, \"Smash shelves —\" \"Dumbledore never told you?\" Malfoy repeated. \"Well, this explains why you didn't come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why —\" \"— when I say go —\" \"— you didn't come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording. . . .\" \"Did he?\" said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. \"So he wanted me to come and get it, did he? Why?\" \"Why?\" Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. \"Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him.\" \"And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?\" \"About both of you, Potter, about both of you . . . Haven't you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?\" Harry stared into the slitted eyeholes through which Malfoy's gray eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry's parents had died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand? \"Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?\" he said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust. \"And he's made me come and get it for him? Why couldn't he come and get it himself?\" \"Get it himself?\" shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter. \"The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?\" \"So he's got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?\" said Harry. \"Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?\" \"Very good, Potter, very good . . .\" said Malfoy slowly. \"But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell —\" \"NOW!\" yelled Harry. Five different voices behind him bellowed \"REDUCTO!\" Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor — \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of Hermione's robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres — Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout \"Stupefy!\" and the hand released him at once. They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione's voice urging Neville on. The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them — \"Colloportus!\" gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise. \"Where — where are the others?\" gasped Harry. He had thought that Ron, Luna, and Ginny had been ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there. \"They must have gone the wrong way!\" whispered Hermione, terror in her face. \"Listen!\" whispered Neville. Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed. Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar: \"Leave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care for Nott's injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson, come back here, we need to organize! We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary — Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right — Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight ahead — Macnair and Avery, through here — Rookwood, over there — Mulciber, come with me!\" \"What do we do?\" Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot. \"Well, we don't stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,\" said Harry. \"Let's get away from this door. . . .\" They ran, quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, toward the exit into the  circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut. \"Stand aside!\" said a rough voice. \"Alohomora!\" As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione, and Neville dived under desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters' robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly. \"They might've run straight through to the hall,\" said the rough voice. \"Check under the desks,\" said another. Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend. Poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted, \"STUPEFY !\" A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry's spell and now pointed his own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim. \"Avada —\" Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, \"EXPELLIARMUS !\" Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front and Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck at what he had done. \"Get out of the way, Harry!\" yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage. Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted, \"STUPEFY !\"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater's shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses. The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered — The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned — his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, \"STUP —\" \"STUPEFY !\" screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest; he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind. \"Accio Wand !\" cried Hermione. Harry's wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him. \"Thanks,\" he said, \"right, let's get out of —\" \"Look out!\" said Neville, horrified, staring at the Death Eater's head in the bell jar. All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck. They were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man's head. It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull, his cheeks smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz. . . . A baby's head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again. But even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again, thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin. . . . \"It's time,\" said Hermione in an awestruck voice. \"Time . . .\" The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together again, it began to shrink back to babyhood once more. . . . There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream. \"RON?\" Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. \"GINNY? LUNA?\" \"Harry!\" Hermione screamed. The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby's head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing Harry, who ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm. \"You can't hurt a baby!\" There was no time to argue the point. Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position. \"Come on!\" he said again, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them, they took off for the door that stood ajar at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway. They had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room toward them. Veering left he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the door behind them. \"Collo —\" began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled, \"IMPEDIMENTA!\" Harry, Hermione, and Neville were all knocked backward off their feet. Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry's head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes, and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react. \"WE'VE GOT HIM!\" yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry, \"IN AN OFFICE OFF —\" \"Silencio!\" cried Hermione, and the man's voice was extinguished. He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward, facedown onto the rug at Harry's feet, stiff as a board and unable to move at all. \"Well done, Ha —\" But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of what looked like purple flame. It passed right across Hermione's chest; she gave a tiny \"oh!\" as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where she lay motionless. \"HERMIONE!\" Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly toward her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville's head as he emerged — his foot broke Neville's wand in two and connected with his face — Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts. Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harry's hand, to himself, then at Hermione. Though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been clearer: Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her. . . . \"Like you won't kill us all the moment I hand it over anyway!\" said Harry. A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly. He had one hand on Hermione's shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don't let her be dead, don't let her be dead, it's my fault if she's dead. . . . \"Whaddever you do, Harry,\" said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, \"don'd gib it to him!\" Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him. Harry seized his chance: \"PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!\" The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it, and he toppled forward across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch. \"Hermione,\" Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again. \"Hermione, wake up. . . .\" \"Whaddid he do to her?\" said Neville, crawling out from under the desk again to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose. \"I dunno. . . .\" Neville groped for Hermione's wrist. \"Dat's a pulse, Harry, I'b sure id is. . . .\" Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed. \"She's alive?\" \"Yeah, I dink so. . . .\" There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sounds of CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby Death Eater in the next room. \"Neville, we're not far from the exit,\" Harry whispered. \"We're right next to that circular room. . . . If we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I'll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift. . . . Then you could find someone. . . . Raise the alarm . . .\" \"And whad are you going do do?\" said Neville, mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry. \"I've got to find the others,\" said Harry. \"Well, I'b going do find dem wid you,\" said Neville firmly. \"But Hermione —\" \"We'll dake her wid us,\" said Neville firmly. \"I'll carry her — you're bedder at fighding dem dan I ab —\" He stood up and seized one of Hermione's arms, glared at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione's limp form over Neville's shoulders. \"Wait,\" said Harry, snatching up Hermione's wand from the floor and shoving it into Nevilles hand, \"you'd better take this. . . .\" Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly toward the door. \"My gran's going do kill be,\" said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, \"dat was by dad's old wand. . . .\" Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter, and repair itself on the wall behind them. \"He's never going to notice us,\" he whispered. \"C'mon . . . keep close behind me. . . .\" They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forward, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione's weight. The door of the Time Room swung shut behind them, and the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of Harry's head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart Harry saw that Hermione's fiery crosses had faded from the doors. \"So which way d'you reck — ?\" But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it. \"Ron!\" croaked Harry, dashing toward them. \"Ginny — are you all — ?\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the front of Harry's robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes. \"There you are. . . . Ha ha ha . . . You look funny, Harry. . . . You're all messed up. . . . Ron's face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry's robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow. \"Ginny?\" Harry said fearfully. \"What happened?\" But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle. \"I think her ankle's broken, I heard something crack,\" whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt. \"Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark —\" \"Harry, we saw Uranus up close!\" said Ron, still giggling feebly. \"Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus — ha ha ha —\"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron's mouth and burst. \"Anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny's foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but . . .\" Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed. \"And what about Ron?\" said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry's robes. \"I don't know what they hit him with,\" said Luna sadly, \"but he's gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all. . . .\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, pulling Harry's ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, \"you know who this girl is, Harry? She's Loony . . . Loony Lovegood . . . ha ha ha . . .\" \"We've got to get out of here,\" said Harry firmly. \"Luna, can you help Ginny?\" \"Yes,\" said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, putting an arm around Ginny's waist and pulling her up. \"It's only my ankle, I can do it myself!\" said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Ron's arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dudley's. He looked around: They had a one-in-twelve chance of getting the exit right the first time — He heaved Ron toward a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped into the hall, led by Bellatrix Lestrange. \"There they are!\" she shrieked. Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him, and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione. They were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix. \"Colloportus!\" shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side. \"It doesn't matter!\" said a man's voice. \"There are other ways in — WE'VE GOT THEM, THEY'RE HERE!\" Harry spun around. They were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first. \"Luna — Neville — help me!\" The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door. \"Colloportus!\" There were footsteps running along behind the doors; every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered. Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall — then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry, \"Collo — aaaaaaaaargh . . .\" He turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione. \"Get Potter!\" shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him. He dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy — \"Hey!\" said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward Harry, giggling. \"Hey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn't that weird, Harry?\" \"Ron, get out of the way, get down —\" But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank. \"Honest, Harry, they're brains — look — Accio Brain!\" The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny, and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish. For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared toward Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film — \"Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it —\" said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards. \"Harry, come and touch it, bet it's weird —\" \"RON, NO!\" Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands. The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron's arms like ropes. \"Harry, look what's happen — no — no, I don't like it — no, stop — stop —\" But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron's chest now. He tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus's body. \"Diffindo!\" yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds. \"Harry, it'll suffocate him!\" screamed Ginny, immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor — then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater's wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious. \"STUBEFY !\" shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermione's wand at the oncoming Death Eaters. \"STUBEFY, STUBEFY !\" But nothing happened — one of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that left craters in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange sprinted right at him. Holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others. It seemed to have worked. They streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come. Inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron — find some way of releasing him — he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish — He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters' laughter. He looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending toward him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench toward him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him. The prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sights. The back of his legs hit something solid; he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed backward onto it. The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the full Body-Bind, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry's face. \"Potter, your race is run,\" drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his mask. \"Now hand me the prophecy like a good boy. . . .\" \"Let — let the others go, and I'll give it to you!\" said Harry desperately.CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE A few of the Death Eaters laughed. \"You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,\" said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure. \"You see, there are ten of us and only one of you . . . or hasn't Dumbledore ever taught you how to count?\" \"He's dot alone!\" shouted a voice from above them. \"He's still god be!\" Harry's heart sank. Neville was scrambling down the stone benches toward them, Hermione's wand held fast in his trembling hand. \"Neville — no — go back to Ron —\" \"STUBEFY !\" Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn, \"STUBEFY ! STUBE —\" One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed. \"It's Longbottom, isn't it?\" sneered Lucius Malfoy. \"Well, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause. . . . Your death will not come as a great shock. . . .\" \"Longbottom?\" repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face. \"Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy. . . .\" \"I DOE YOU HAB!\" roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captor's encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, \"Someone Stun him!\" \"No, no, no,\" said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. \"No, let's see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents. . . . Unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy —\" \"DON'D GIB ID DO DEM!\" roared Neville, who seemed beside himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor, her wand raised. \"DON'D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!\" Bellatrix raised her wand. \"Crucio!\" Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony. \"That was just a taster!\" said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that Neville's screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned and gazed up at Harry. \"Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!\" Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy was hot with the heat from his clutching hand as he held it out. Malfoy jumped forward to take it. Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley. Malfoy turned and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville. \"Are you okay?\" he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads. \"Yes,\" said Neville, trying to pull himself up. \"And Ron?\" \"I dink he's all right — he was still fighding the brain when I left —\" The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville's hand had been seconds before. Both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor. \"Give it to me,\" growled a voice in his ear, \"give me the prophecy —\" The man was pressing so tightly on Harry's windpipe that he could not breathe — through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away. Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix — nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. . . . He turned his wand backward toward the man's side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man's free hand was groping toward the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy — \"AARGH!\" Neville had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione's wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater's mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped, \"STUPEFY !\" The Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off. It was Macnair, Buckbeak's would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot. \"Thanks!\" Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs. Then Harry's foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped — for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, then saw Moody's magic eye spinning away across the floor. Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee. \"Tarantallegra!\" he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again. \"Now, Potter —\" He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, \"Protego!\" Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville's jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell. Dolohov raised his wand again. \"Accio Proph —\" Sirius hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder, and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry's fingers but he had managed to cling to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand tips — Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Once again, Dolohov's arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backward, landing with a crash on his back. \"Nice one!\" shouted Sirius, forcing Harry's head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew toward them. \"Now I want you to get out of —\" They both ducked again. A jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius; across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat, and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back toward the fray. \"Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville, and run!\" Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew over Harry's head as he launched himself toward Neville — \"Can you stand?\" he bellowed in Neville's ear, as Neville's legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably. \"Put your arm round my neck —\" Neville did so — Harry heaved — Neville's legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them. Both fell backward, Neville's legsCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE waving wildly like an overturned beetle's, Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed. \"The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!\" snarled Lucius Malfoy's voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy's wand pressing hard between his ribs. \"No — get — off — me . . . Neville — catch it!\" Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, \"Impedimenta!\" Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them. \"Harry, round up the others and GO!\" Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone steps. Neville's legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight. Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step — A spell hit the stone bench at Harry's heel. It crumbled away and he fell back to the step below: Neville sank to the ground, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and thrust the prophecy into his pocket. \"Come on!\" said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville's robes. \"Just try and push with your legs —\" He gave another stupendous heave and Neville's robes tore all along the left seam — the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and before either of them could catch it, one of Neville's floundering feet kicked it. It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with  hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness. \"Harry, I'b sorry!\" cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder, \"I'b so sorry, Harry, I didn'd bean do —\" \"It doesn't matter!\" Harry shouted. \"Just try and stand, let's get out of —\" \"Dubbledore!\" said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry's shoulder. \"What?\" \"DUBBLEDORE!\" Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body — they were saved. Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thought of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there. There were yells; one of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore's spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line — Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of red light: He was laughing at her. \"Come on, you can do better than that!\" he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room. The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest. The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock.CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore turned to the dais too. It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall. His body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch. . . . And Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather's wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place. Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange's triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing — Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he would reappear from the other side any second. . . . But Sirius did not reappear. \"SIRIUS!\" Harry yelled, \"SIRIUS!\" He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out again. . . . But as he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back. \"There's nothing you can do, Harry —\" \"Get him, save him, he's only just gone through!\" \"It's too late, Harry —\" \"We can still reach him —\" Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go. . . . \"There's nothing you can do, Harry . . . nothing. . . . He's gone.\"\n",

      "He — he sent me this,\" Hermione said, holding out the letter. Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read. \"They can't do this,\" said Harry. \"They can't. Buckbeak isn't dangerous.\" \"Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it,\" said Hermione, wiping her eyes. \"You know what he's like. They're a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there always is. Only I can't see any hope. . . . Nothing will have changed.\" \"Yeah, it will,\" said Ron fiercely. \"You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help.\" \"Oh, Ron!\" Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away. \"Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers . . . ,\" she sobbed. \"Oh — well — he was old,\" said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him. \"And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.\" The safety measures imposed on the students since Black's second break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons. He seemed numb with shock at the verdict. \"S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in black robes an' I kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them dates yeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an' said his bit, and the Committee jus' did exac'ly what he told 'em. . . .\" \"There's still the appeal!\" said Ron fiercely. \"Don't give up yet, we're working on it!\" They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class. Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively. \"S'no good, Ron,\" said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps. \"That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket. I'm jus' gonna make sure the rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had. I owe him that. . . .\" Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried in his handkerchief. \"Look at him blubber!\" Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors, listening. \"Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?\" said Malfoy. \"And he's supposed to be our teacher!\" Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got there first — SMACK! She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again. \"Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you evil —\" \"Hermione!\" said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung it back. \"Get off, Ron!\" Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered. \"C'mon,\" Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons. \"Hermione!\" Ron said again, sounding both stunned and impressed. \"Harry, you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final!\" Hermione said shrilly. \"You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin wins!\" \"We're due in Charms,\" said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. \"We'd better go.\" They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's classroom. \"You're late, boys!\" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened the classroom door. \"Come along, quickly, wands out, we're experimenting with Cheering Charms today, we've already divided into pairs —\" Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron looked behind him. \"Where's Hermione gone?\" Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door. \"That's weird,\" said Harry, staring at Ron. \"Maybe — maybe she went to the bathroom or something?\" But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson. \"She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too,\" said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly — the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment. Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried. \"You don't think Malfoy did something to her?\" Ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (\"Flibbertigibbet\"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room. Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake. \"Wh — what?\" said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly around. \"Is it time to go? W — which lesson have we got now? \"Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes,\" said Harry. \"Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?\" \"What? Oh no!\" Hermione squeaked. \"I forgot to go to Charms!\" \"But how could you forget?\" said Harry. \"You were with us till we were right outside the classroom!\" \"I don't believe it!\" Hermione wailed. \"Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!\" \"You know what, Hermione?\" said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. \"I reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much.\" \"No, I'm not!\" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. \"I just made a mistake, that's all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry. . . . I'll see you in Divination!\" Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor  Trelawney's classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harassed. \"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!\" Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table. \"I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term,\" Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby. \"Don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry,\" Harry muttered back. \"I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.\" \"Good day to you!\" said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal ball. \"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around. \"The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.\" Hermione snorted. \"Well, honestly . . . 'the fates have informed her' . . . who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!\" she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs. It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them, as her face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had not. \"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,\" she said dreamily. \"I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes\" — Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise — \"so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will See before the end of the class.\" And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as \"this is stupid\" kept drifting across it. It didn't help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting. \"Seen anything yet?\" Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour's quiet crystal gazing. \"Yeah, there's a burn on this table,\" said Ron, pointing. \"Someone's spilled their candle.\" \"This is such a waste of time,\" Hermione hissed. \"I could be practicing something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms —\" Professor Trelawney rustled past. \"Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?\" she murmured over the clinking of her bangles. \"I don't need help,\" Ron whispered. \"It's obvious what this means. There's going to be loads of fog tonight.\" Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing. \"Now, really!\" said Professor Trelawney as everyone's heads turned in their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. \"You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!\" She approached their table and peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He was sure he knew what was coming — \"There is something here!\" Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering her face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses. \"Something moving . . . but what is it?\" Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, including his Firebolt, that it wasn't good news, whatever it was. And sure enough — \"My dear . . . ,\" Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. \"It is here, plainer than ever before . . . my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer . . . the Gr —\" \"Oh, for goodness' sake!\" said Hermione loudly. \"Not that ridiculous Grim again!\" Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione's face. Parvati whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable anger. \"I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class, my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don't remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.\" There was a moment's silence. Then — \"Fine!\" said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into her bag. \"Fine!\" she repeated, swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. \"I give up! I'm leaving!\" And to the whole class's amazement, Hermione strode over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight. It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turned abruptly from Harry and Ron's table, breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her. \"Ooooo!\" said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. \"Oooooo, Professor Trelawney, I've just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn't you? Didn't you, Professor? 'Around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever!' You said it ages ago, Professor!\" Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile. \"Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us. One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs. . . . The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know. . . .\" Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that Professor Trelawney could join their table instead. \"Some day Hermione's having, eh?\" Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed. \"Yeah . . .\" Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? The last thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch final drawing ever nearer. The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and he wasn't the only one. \"Call this a holiday!\" Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon. \"The exams are ages away, what're they playing at?\" But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she was taking more subjects than anybody else. She was usually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin's under her eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears. Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal. When he wasn't doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so absorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks. Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quid-ditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) that they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. It also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points. \"So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up,\" Wood told Harry constantly. \"Only if we're more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You've got that, haven't you? You must catch the Snitch only if we're —\" \"I KNOW, OLIVER!\" Harry yelled. The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming  match. Gryffindor hadn't won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron's second oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment. Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buck-beak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school. Never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears. Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn't walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people. Wood had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his Firebolt's safety than his own. When he wasn't flying it, he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still there. All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the night before the match. Even Hermione had put down her books. \"I can't work, I can't concentrate,\" she said nervously. There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred's and George's jokes. Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he did, he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomach. \"You're going to be fine,\" Hermione told him, though she looked positively terrified. \"You've got a Firebolt!\" said Ron. \"Yeah . . . ,\" said Harry, his stomach writhing. It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, \"Team! Bed!\" Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood was yelling, \"Where were you? We had to use Neville instead!\" Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth, when he realized he had forgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and woke with a start. It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn't taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went to pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window. The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless and innocent-looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfect. Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn. Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn't be the Grim — not now — not right before the match — He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute's frantic searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now. . . . It wasn't the Grim at all . . . it was a cat. . . . Harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only Crookshanks. . . . Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too. And just then, it emerged — a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it be an omen of Harry's death? \"Ron!\" Harry hissed. \"Ron! Wake up!\" \"Huh?\" \"I need you to tell me if you can see something!\" \"S'all dark, Harry,\" Ron muttered thickly. \"What're you on about?\" \"Down here —\" Harry looked quickly back out of the window. Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren't there. Where had they gone? A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again. Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn't help grinning broadly as he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual. Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching nothing himself. Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again. \"Good luck, Harry!\" called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing. \"Okay — no wind to speak of — sun's a bit bright, that could  impair your vision, watch out for it — ground's fairly hard, good, that'll give us a fast kickoff —\" Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally, they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn. \"Locker rooms,\" said Wood tersely. None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he'd eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at all, Wood was saying, \"Okay, it's time, let's go —\" They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Three-quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like \"GO GRYFFINDOR!\" and \"LIONS FOR THE CUP!\" Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile. \"And here are the Gryffindors!\" yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as commentator as usual. \"Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years —\" Lee's comments were drowned by a tide of \"boos\" from the Slytherin end. \"And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He's made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill —\" More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person on the Slytherin team; the rest of them were enormous. \"Captains, shake hands!\" said Madam Hooch. Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other's hand very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other's fingers. \"Mount your brooms!\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three . . . two . . . one . . .\" The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch. \"And it's Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of Gryffindor with the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no — Quaffle intercepted by Warring-ton, Warrington of Slytherin tearing up the field — WHAM! — nice Bludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it's caught by — Johnson, Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina — nice swerve around Montague — duck, Angelina, that's a Bludger! — SHE SCORES! TEN&ndash;ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\" Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight — \"OUCH!\" Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her. \"Sorry!\" said Flint as the crowd below booed. \"Sorry, didn't see her!\" A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater's club at the back of Flint's head. Flint's nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed. \"That will do!\" shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between them. \"Penalty shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!\" \"Come off it, Miss!\" howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Alicia flew forward to take the penalty. \"Come on, Alicia!\" yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd. \"YES! SHE'S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY&ndash;ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely, fly forward to take the Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched. \" 'Course, Wood's a superb Keeper!\" Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint waited for Madam Hooch's whistle. \"Superb! Very difficult to pass — very difficult indeed — YES! I DON'T BELIEVE IT! HE'S SAVED IT!\" Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still making sure he caught every word of Lee's commentary. It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty points up — \"Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession — no! — Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she's streaking up the field — THAT WAS DELIBERATE!\" Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie,  and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cartwheeled in the air, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle. Madam Hooch's whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the Slytherin Seeker. \"THIRTY&ndash;ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING —\" \"Jordan, if you can't commentate in an unbiased way — !\" \"I'm telling it like it is, Professor!\" Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn't catch it yet — and if Malfoy saw it — Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Fire-bolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end — it worked. Malfoy went haring after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there. . . . WHOOSH. One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry's right ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again — WHOOSH. The second Bludger grazed Harry's elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was closing in. Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him, clubs raised — He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch. \"Ha haaa!\" yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching their heads. \"Too bad, boys! You'll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt! And it's Gryffindor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside her — poke him in the eye, Angelina! — it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke — oh no — Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal posts, come on now, Wood, save — !\" But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him. \"Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won't happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession —\" It was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he'd thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the score forty-ten to Gryffindor. The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it — once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead — Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred's and George's absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after the other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded. Madam Hooch was beside herself. \"YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING AREA!\" she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. \"Gryffindor penalty!\" And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal — seventy-ten. The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse — Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him. And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him. Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down — Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back. \"You —\" Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn't reach — Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he'd wanted to do — the Snitch had disappeared again. \"Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I've never seen such tactics!\" Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his Nimbus Two Thousand and One. \"YOU CHEATING SCUM!\" Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall's reach. \"YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B —\" Professor McGonagall didn't even bother to tell him off. She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoy's direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was shouting furiously. Alicia took Gryffindor's penalty, but she was so angry she missed by several feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy's foul on Harry, were being spurred on to greater heights. \"Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal — Montague scores —\" Lee groaned. \"Seventy-twenty to Gryffindor. . . .\" Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other. Harry wasn't going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch. . . . \"Get out of it, Potter!\" Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found Harry blocking him. \"Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina, COME ON!\" Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins. \"AAAAAAARRRGH!\" They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina's way was clear. \"SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty points to twenty!\" Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field. And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face — there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer — Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead — \"Go! Go! Go!\" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfoy — Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him — he was at Malfoy's ankles — he was level — Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy's arm out of the way and — \"YES!\" He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers. Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina's, Alicia's, and Katie's voices, \"We've won the Cup! We've won the Cup!\" Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth. Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him. Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into the light, he saw Hagrid, plastered with crimson rosettes — \"Yeh beat 'em, Harry, yeh beat 'em! Wait till I tell Buckbeak!\" There was Percy, jumping up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup. If only there had been a dementor around. . . . As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world's best Patronus.\n",

      "Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle. The front door had remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood. \"What sort of time do you call this?\" \"I'm really sorry — I had to go out for something important —\" \"Well, the password changed at midnight, so you'll just have to sleep in the corridor, won't you?\" \"You're joking!\" said Harry. \"Why did it have to change at midnight?\" \"That's the way it is,\" said the Fat Lady. \"If you're angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he's the one who's tightened security.\" \"Fantastic,\" said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. \"Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he's the one who wanted me to —\" \"He is here,\" said a voice behind Harry. \"Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.\" Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff. \"I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,\" said Nick. \"He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.\" \"Where is he?\" said Harry, his heart leaping. \"Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it's a favorite pastime of his —\" \"Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!\" \"Oh — in his office,\" said Nick. \"I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in —\" \"Yeah, he has,\" said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him. \"Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password's still 'tapeworm'!\" But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying \"toffee &eacute;clairs\" to Dumbledore's gargoyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. \"Enter,\" said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore's office,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows. \"Good gracious, Harry,\" said Dumbledore in surprise. \"To what do I owe this very late pleasure?\" \"Sir — I've got it. I've got the memory from Slughorn.\" Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. \"Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!\" All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn's memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve. \"And now,\" said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. \"Now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .\" Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn's office many years before. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple. And there were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo's gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, \"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\" \"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you,\" said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. \"I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\" Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. \"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn't, and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite —\" Several of the boys tittered again. \"— I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts at the Ministry.\" Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader. \"I don't know that politics would suit me, sir,\" he said when the laughter had died away. \"I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing.\" A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader's famous ancestor. \"Nonsense,\" said Slughorn briskly, \"couldn't be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around. \"Good gracious, is it that time already? You'd better get going, boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\" One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there. \"Look sharp, Tom, you don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect . . .\" \"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\" \"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. . . .\" \"Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?\" Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass. \"Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?\" But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork. \"Not exactly, sir,\" said Riddle. \"I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.\" \"No . . . well . . . you'd be hard-pushed to find a book at Hog-warts that'll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,\" said Slughorn. \"But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you — sorry, I mean, if you can't tell me, obviously — I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could — so I just thought I'd ask —\" It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. \"Well,\" said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, \"well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.\" \"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir,\" said Riddle. His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. \"Well, you split your soul, you see,\" said Slughorn, \"and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form . . .\" Slughorn's face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before: \"I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive.\" \". . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.\" But Riddle's hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. \"How do you split your soul?\" \"Well,\" said Slughorn uncomfortably, \"you must understandCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.\" \"But how do you do it?\" \"By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —\" \"Encase? But how — ?\" \"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!\" said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \"Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer?\" \"No, sir, of course not,\" said Riddle quickly. \"I'm sorry . . . I didn't mean to offend . . .\" \"Not at all, not at all, not offended,\" said Slughorn gruffly. \"It's natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle. \"What I don't understand, though — just out of curiosity — I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven — ?\" \"Merlin's beard, Tom!\" yelped Slughorn. \"Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .\" Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all. \"Of course,\" he muttered, \"this is all hypothetical, what we're discussing, isn't it? All academic . . .\" \"Yes, sir, of course,\" said Riddle quickly. \"But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I've told — that's to say, what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore's particularly fierce about it. . . .\" \"I won't say a word, sir,\" said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . . \"Thank you, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Let us go. . . .\" When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak. \"I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore at last. \"It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. . . .\" Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. \"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \"You think he succeeded then, sir?\" asked Harry. \"He made a Horcrux? And that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\" \"A bit . . . or more,\" said Dumbledore. \"You heard Voldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know — as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.\" Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thoughts, and then said, \"Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\" \"Where?\" asked Harry \"How?\" \"You handed it to me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"The diary, Riddle's diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\" \"I don't understand, sir,\" said Harry. \"Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. . . . a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. \"What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.\" \"I still don't understand,\" said Harry. \"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again.\" \"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted,\" said Harry. \"He wanted people to know he was Slytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time.\" \"Quite correct,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blas&eacute; about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. \"The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made — or been planning to make — more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. \"Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. 'I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.' That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody,' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring toCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil' . . .\" \"So he's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?\" said Harry. \"Why couldn't he make a Sorcerer's Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?\" \"Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,\" said Dumbledore. \"But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort. \"While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain their immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see . . . or as close to immortal as any man can be. \"But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: 'Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most powerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\" \"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or invisible —\" \"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in his body.\" \"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\" \"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been — forgive me the lack of seemly modesty — for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \"But how did you find it?\" \"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts' house. It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. \"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\" \"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be old tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .\" \"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\" \"The diary wasn't that special.\" \"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the  Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.\" \"So, the other Horcruxes?\" said Harry. \"Do you think you know what they are, sir?\" \"I can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\" \"The locket!\" said Harry loudly. \"Hufflepuff 's cup!\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\" Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. \"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hog-warts, sir?\" said Harry. \"To try and find something from one of the other founders?\" \"My thoughts precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.\" \"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry, counting on his fingers. \"Unless he got both?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?\" \"The snake?\" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes?\" \"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the intention of killing you. \"He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. \"As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort's mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\" \"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dumbledore, bowing his head. \"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school?\" \"Correct,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have been looking for a very long time. I think . . . perhaps . . . I may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.\" \"And if you do,\" said Harry quickly, \"can I come with you and help get rid of it?\" Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \"Yes, I think so.\" \"I can?\" said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \"I think you have earned that right.\" Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore's decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. \"Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?\" Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. \"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do.CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\" \"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hog-warts?\" \"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemort's say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary. \"No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius's fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master's soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemort's fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\" Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \"So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?\" \"Yes, I think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.\" \"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —\" \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\" \"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\" \"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means — love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. \"Yes — just love,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!\" \"But it comes to the same —\" \"No, it doesn't!\" said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, \"You are setting too much store by the prophecy!\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \"But,\" spluttered Harry, \"but you said the prophecy means —\" \"If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?\" \"But,\" said Harry, bewildered, \"but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other —\" \"Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\" \"But —\" \"It is essential that you understand this!\" said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. \"By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort's followers!\" \"Of course I haven't!\" said Harry indignantly. \"He killed my mum and dad!\" \"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! \"But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.\" \"But, sir,\" said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, \"it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or —\" \"Got to?\" said Dumbledore. \"Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\" Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. \"I'd want him finished,\" said Harry quietly. \"And I'd want to do it.\" \"Of course you would!\" cried Dumbledore. \"You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that —\" \"That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\" said Harry. \"Yes.\" But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world.\n",

      "They had expected to have to comb Hermione's Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Um-bridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline: MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER \"HIGH INQUISITOR\" \" 'High Inquisitor'?\" said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast slipping from his fingers. \"What does that mean?\" Hermione read aloud: \"In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \"'The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts for some time,' said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. 'He is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve.' \"This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person. \"'That's how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,' said Weasley last night. 'Dumbledore couldn't find anyone, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she's been an immediate success —' \" \"She's been a WHAT?\" said Harry loudly. \"Wait, there's more,\" said Hermione grimly. \" '— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-theground feedback about what's really happening at Hogwarts.' \"It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new position of 'Hogwarts High Inquisitor.' \"'This is an exciting new phase in the Minister's plan to get to grips with what some are calling the \"falling standards\" at Hogwarts,' said Weasley. 'The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post, and we are delighted to say that she has accepted.' \"The Ministry's new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts. \"'I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,' said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. 'Many of us with our children's best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore's eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.' \"Among those 'eccentric decisions' are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional ex-Auror 'Mad-Eye' Moody. \"Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts. \"'I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,' said a Ministry insider last night. \"Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts. \"'Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge's office,' said Madam Marchbanks. 'This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Al-bus Dumbledore.' (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks' alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17).\" Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two. \"So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed this 'Educational Decree' and forced her on us! And now he's given her the power to inspect other teachers!\" Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright. \"I can't believe this. It's outrageous. . . .\" \"I know it is,\" said Harry. He looked down at his right hand, clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin. But a grin was unfurling on Ron's face. \"What?\" said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him. \"Oh, I can't wait to see McGonagall inspected,\" said Ron happily. \"Umbridge won't know what's hit her.\" \"Well, come on,\" said Hermione, jumping up, \"we'd better get going, if she's inspecting Binns's class we don't want to be late. . . .\" But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in Snape's dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry's moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner. \"I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,\" said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, passing back their homework. \"This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.\" Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them. \"The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week's essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D's.\" He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, \"Some people got D's? Ha!\" Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information private. Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione's but it was at least blue rather than pink, like Neville's, and he delivered a flask of it to Snape's desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief. \"Well, that wasn't as bad as last week, was it?\" said Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall toward lunch. \"And the homework didn't go too badly either, did it?\" When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, \"I mean, all right, I didn't expect the top grade, not if he's marking to O.W.L. standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn't you say?\" Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat. \"Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we've got plenty of time to improve, but the grades we're getting now are a sort of baseline, aren't they? Something we can build on . . .\" They sat down together at the Gryffindor table. \"Obviously, I'd have been thrilled if I'd gotten an O —\" \"Hermione,\" said Ron sharply, \"if you want to know what grades we got, ask.\" \"I don't — I didn't mean — well, if you want to tell me —\" \"I got a P,\" said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. \"Happy?\" \"Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of,\" said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry's right. \"Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.\" \"But,\" said Hermione, \"doesn't P stand for . . .\" \" 'Poor,' yeah,\" said Lee Jordan. \"Still, better than D, isn't it? 'Dreadful'?\" Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades. \"So top grade's O for 'Outstanding,' \" she was saying, \"and then there's A —\" \"No, E,\" George corrected her, \"E for 'Exceeds Expectations.' And I've always thought Fred and I should've got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.\" They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, \"So after E, it's A for 'Acceptable,' and that's the last pass grade, isn't it?\" \"Yep,\" said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth, and swallowing it whole. \"Then you get P for 'Poor' \" — Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration — \"and D for 'Dreadful.' \" \"And then T,\" George reminded him. \"T?\" asked Hermione, looking appalled. \"Even lower than a D? What on earth does that stand for?\" \" 'Troll,' \" said George promptly. Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received T's in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on. \"You lot had an inspected lesson yet?\" Fred asked them. \"No,\" said Hermione at once, \"have you?\" \"Just now, before lunch,\" said George. \"Charms.\" \"What was it like?\" Harry and Hermione asked together. Fred shrugged. \"Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard. You know what Flitwick's like, he treated her like a guest, didn't seem to bother him at all. She didn't say much. Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it.\" \"I can't see old Flitwick getting marked down,\" said George, \"he usually gets everyone through their exams all right.\" \"Who've you got this afternoon?\" Fred asked Harry. \"Trelawney —\" \"A T if ever I saw one —\" \"— and Umbridge herself.\" \"Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,\" said George. \"Angelina'll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.\" But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out Dream Oracles, look round. \"Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,\" said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile. \"You received my note, I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?\" Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney's seat. She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin. Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses. \"We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,\" she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly. \"Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each other's latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.\" She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Um-bridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati's most recent dream. Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney's wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book. \"Think of a dream, quick,\" he told Ron, \"in case the old toad comes our way.\" \"I did it last time,\" Ron protested, \"it's your turn, you tell me one.\" \"Oh, I dunno . . .\" said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. \"Let's say I dreamed I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that'll do. . . .\" Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle. \"Okay, we've got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject . . . would that be 'drowning' or 'cauldron' or 'Snape'?\" \"It doesn't matter, pick any of them,\" said Harry, chancing a glance behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney's shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary. \"What night did you dream this again?\" Ron said, immersed in calculations. \"I dunno, last night, whenever you like,\" Harry told him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out. \"Now,\" said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, \"you've been in this post how long, exactly?\" Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, \"Nearly sixteen years.\" \"Quite a period,\" said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. \"So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?\" \"That's right,\" said Professor Trelawney shortly. Professor Umbridge made another note. \"And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?\" \"Yes,\" said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher. Another note on the clipboard. \"But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?\" \"These things often skip — er — three generations,\" said Professor Trelawney. Professor Umbridge's toadlike smile widened. \"Of course,\" she said sweetly, making yet another note. \"Well, if you could just predict something for me, then?\" She looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Professor Trelawney had stiffened as though unable to believe her ears. \"I don't understand you,\" said Professor Trelawney, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck. \"I'd like you to make a prediction for me,\" said Professor Umbridge very clearly. Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height, her beads and bangles clinking. \"The Inner Eye does not See upon command!\" she said in scandalized tones. \"I see,\" said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her clipboard. \"I — but — but . . . wait!\" said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. \"I . . . I think I do see something . . . something that concerns you. . . . Why, I sense something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril . . .\" Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Um-bridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised. \"I am afraid . . . I am afraid that you are in grave danger!\" Professor Trelawney finished dramatically. There was a pause. Professor Umbridge's eyebrows were still raised. \"Right,\" she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more. \"Well, if that's really the best you can do . . .\" She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron's eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: They both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney's side — until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that was. \"Well?\" she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry's nose, uncharacteristically brisk. \"Let me see the start you've made on your dream diary, please.\" And by the time she had interpreted Harry's dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic toward her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later. She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell. \"Wands away,\" she instructed them all smilingly, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags. \"As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, 'Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation.' There will be no need to talk.\" Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year's lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again. Professor Umbridge had noticed too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione, she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, \"What is it this time, Miss Granger?\" \"I've already read chapter two,\" said Hermione. \"Well then, proceed to chapter three.\" \"I've read that too. I've read the whole book.\" Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly. \"Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen.\" \"He says that counterjinxes are improperly named,\" said Hermione promptly. \"He says 'counterjinx' is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.\" Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows, and Harry knew she was impressed against her will. \"But I disagree,\" Hermione continued. Professor Umbridge's eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder. \"You disagree?\" \"Yes, I do,\" said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the class's attention. \"Mr. Slinkhard doesn't like jinxes, does he? But I think they can be very useful when they're used defensively.\" \"Oh, you do, do you?\" said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. \"Well, I'm afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard's opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.\" \"But —\" Hermione began. \"That is enough,\" said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. \"Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House.\" There was an outbreak of muttering at this. \"What for?\" said Harry angrily. \"Don't you get involved!\" Hermione whispered urgently to him. \"For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,\" said Professor Umbridge smoothly. \"I am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but as none of them — with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects — would have passed a Ministry inspection —\" \"Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,\" said Harry loudly, \"there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.\" This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then — \"I think another week's detentions would do you some good, Mr. Potter,\" said Umbridge sleekly. The cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and by the following morning, it was bleeding again. He did not complain during the evening's detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter. The very worst part of this second week's worth of detentions was, just as George had predicted, Angelina's reaction. She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table. \"Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But Professor — he's gone and landed himself in detention again —\" \"What's this, Potter?\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry. \"Detention? From whom?\" \"From Professor Umbridge,\" muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall's beady, square-framed eyes. \"Are you telling me,\" she said, lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, \"that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge's class again?\" \"Yes,\" Harry muttered, speaking to the floor. \"Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for serious trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But — what? Professor, no!\" Harry said, furious at this injustice. \"I'm already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well?\" \"Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you what- soever!\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. \"No, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy!\" She strode back toward the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which Harry flung himself onto the bench beside Ron, fuming. \"She's taken points off Gryffindor because I'm having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?\" \"I know, mate,\" said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto Harry's plate, \"she's bang out of order.\" Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing. \"You think McGonagall was right, do you?\" said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione's face. \"I wish she hadn't taken points from you, but I think she's right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,\" said Hermione's voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech. Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger; Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head. \"Excellent,\" whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. \"Let's see Umbridge get what she deserves.\" Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there. \"That will do,\" she said and silence fell immediately. \"Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown, please take this box of mice — don't be silly, girl, they won't hurt you — and hand one to each student —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back Harry's essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A. \"Right then, everyone, listen closely — Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention — most of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell. Today we shall be —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Professor Umbridge. \"Yes?\" said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line. \"I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec —\" \"Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,\" said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks of glee. \"As I was saying, today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell —\" \"Hem, hem.\" \"I wonder,\" said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, \"how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.\" Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more. \"As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So — you know the incantation, let me see what you can do. . . .\" \"How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge!\" Harry said to Ron under his voice, but he was grinning; his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated. Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought that Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however, take many more notes while she sat in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim expression on her face. \"Well, it's a start,\" said Ron, holding up a long, wriggling mouse tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around. As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teacher's desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop. \"How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\" Professor Um-bridge asked. \"Thirty-nine years this December,\" said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut. Professor Umbridge made a note. \"Very well,\" she said, \"you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days' time.\" \"I can hardly wait,\" said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off toward the door. \"Hurry up, you three,\" she added, sweeping Harry, Ron, and Hermione before her. Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return. He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong. When they walked down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"You do not usually take this class, is that correct?\" Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living twigs. \"Quite correct,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet. \"I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.\" Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry. \"Hmm,\" said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly, \"I wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid's very extended leave of absence?\" Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly. \" 'Fraid I can't,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. \"Don't know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks teaching work, accepted — that's as much as I know. Well . . . shall I get started then?\" \"Yes, please do,\" said Professor Umbridge, scribbling upon her clipboard. Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among the students, questioning them on magical creatures. Most people were able to answer well and Harry's spirits lifted somewhat; at least the class was not letting Hagrid down. \"Overall,\" said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor GrubblyPlank's side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, \"how do you, as a temporary member of staff — an objective outsider, I suppose  you might say — how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management?\" \"Oh, yes, Dumbledore's excellent,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily. \"No, I'm very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.\" Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on, \"And what are you planning to cover with this class this year — assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return?\" \"Oh, I'll take them through the creatures that most often come up in O.W.L.,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"Not much left to do — they've studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we'd cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know. . . .\" \"Well, you seem to know what you're doing, at any rate,\" said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis she put on \"you\" and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle: \"Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class?\" Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question. \"That was me,\" he said. \"I was slashed by a hippogriff.\" \"A hippogriff?\" said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically. \"Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,\" said Harry angrily. Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harry's direction. \"Another night's detention, I think,\" she said softly. \"Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that's all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.\" \"Jolly good,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Um-bridge set off back across the lawn to the castle. It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge's office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical. \"Here,\" she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward him, \"soak your hand in that, it's a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.\" Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down. \"Thanks,\" he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks's ears with his left hand. \"I still reckon you should complain about this,\" said Ron in a low voice. \"No,\" said Harry flatly. \"McGonagall would go nuts if she knew —\" \"Yeah, she probably would,\" said Harry. \"And how long d'you reckon it'd take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?\" Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way. \"She's an awful woman,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \"Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we've got to do something about her.\" \"I suggested poison,\" said Ron grimly. \"No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any defense from her at all,\" said Hermione. \"Well, what can we do about that?\" said Ron, yawning. \" 'S too late, isn't it? She got the job, she's here to stay, Fudge'll make sure of that.\" \"Well,\" said Hermione tentatively. \"You know, I was thinking today. . . .\" She shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, \"I was thinking that — maybe the time's come when we should just — just do it ourselves.\" \"Do what ourselves?\" said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles. \"Well — learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves,\" said Hermione. \"Come off it,\" groaned Ron. \"You want us to do extra work? D'you realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week?\" \"But this is much more important than homework!\" said Hermione. Harry and Ron goggled at her. \"I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework,\" said Ron. \"Don't be silly, of course there is!\" said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in her. \"It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting out there. It's about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don't learn anything for a whole year —\" \"We can't do much by ourselves,\" said Ron in a defeated voice. \"I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose —\" \"No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,\" said Hermione. \"We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we're going wrong.\" \"If you're talking about Lupin . . .\" Harry began. \"No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,\" said Hermione. \"He's too busy with the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that's not nearly often enough.\" \"Who, then?\" said Harry, frowning at her. Hermione heaved a very deep sigh. \"Isn't it obvious?\" she said. \"I'm talking about you, Harry.\" There was a moment's silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered. \"About me what?\" said Harry. \"I'm talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.\" Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry's consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated. He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, \"That's an idea.\" \"What's an idea?\" said Harry. \"You,\" said Ron. \"Teaching us to do it.\" \"But . . .\" Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg. \"But I'm not a teacher, I can't —\" \"Harry, you're the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione. \"Me?\" said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. \"No I'm not, you've beaten me in every test —\" \"Actually, I haven't,\" said Hermione coolly. \"You beat me in our third year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I'm not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you've done!\" \"How d'you mean?\" \"You know what, I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,\" Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. \"Let's think,\" he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. \"Uh . . . first year — you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.\" \"But that was luck,\" said Harry, \"that wasn't skill —\" \"Second year,\" Ron interrupted, \"you killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle.\" \"Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up I —\" \"Third year,\" said Ron, louder still, \"you fought off about a hundred dementors at once —\" \"You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't —\" \"Last year,\" Ron said, almost shouting now, \"you fought off YouKnow-Who again —\" \"Listen to me!\" said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. \"Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck — I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I didn't plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help —\" Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn't even sure why he was feeling so angry. \"Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn't I?\" he said heatedly. \"I know what went on, all right? And I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because — because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right — but I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing — STOP LAUGHING!\" The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn't remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and Hermione's smiles had vanished. \"You don't know what it's like! You — neither of you — you've never had to face him, have you? You think it's just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you're in class or something? The whole time you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own — your own brain or guts or whatever — like you can think straight when you know you're about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die — they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that — and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up — you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me —\" \"We weren't saying anything like that, mate,\" said Ron, looking aghast. \"We weren't having a go at Diggory, we didn't — you've got the wrong end of the —\" He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken. \"Harry,\" she said timidly, \"don't you see? This . . . this is exactly why we need you. . . . We need to know what it's r-really like . . . facing him . . . facing V-Voldemort.\" It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort's name, and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry. Still breathing hard, he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence. \"Well . . . think about it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"Please?\" Harry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed of his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was agreeing to. Hermione stood up. \"Well, I'm off to bed,\" she said in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it. \"Erm . . . 'night.\" Ron had gotten to his feet too. \"Coming?\" he said awkwardly to Harry. \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"In . . . in a minute. I'll just clear this up.\" He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left. \"Reparo,\" Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china. They flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl. He was suddenly so tired that he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead he got to his feet and followed Ron upstairs. His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors, and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again.\n",

      "Harry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered again. Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out onto the landing, and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher's ancestors, and into the kitchen. He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and when he pushed it open he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment he entered. \"Breakfast,\" she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire. \"M-m-morning, Harry,\" yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning. \"Sleep all right?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"I've b-b-been up all night,\" she said, with another shuddering yawn. \"Come and sit down. . . .\" She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process. \"What do you want, Harry?\" Mrs. Weasley called. \"Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?\" \"Just — just toast, thanks,\" said Harry. Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, \"What were you saying about Scrimgeour?\" \"Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he's been asking Kingsley and me funny questions. . . .\" Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn't. \". . . and I'll have to tell Dumbledore I can't do night duty tomorrow, I'm just t-t-too tired,\" Tonks finished, yawning hugely again. \"I'll cover for you,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I'm okay, I've got a report to finish anyway. . . .\" Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard's robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry. \"How are you feeling?\" Harry shrugged. \"It'll all be over soon,\" Mr. Weasley said bracingly. \"In a few hours' time you'll be cleared.\" Harry said nothing. \"The hearing's on my floor, in Amelia Bones's office. She's Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she's the one who'll be questioning you.\" \"Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,\" said Tonks earnestly. \"She's fair, she'll hear you out.\" Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say. \"Don't lose your temper,\" said Sirius abruptly. \"Be polite and stick to the facts.\" Harry nodded again. \"The law's on your side,\" said Lupin quietly. \"Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.\" Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry's neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him again, then he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head. \"Doesn't it ever lie flat?\" she said desperately. Harry shook his head. Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry. \"I think we'll go now,\" he said. \"We're a bit early, but I think you'll be better off there than hanging around here.\" \"Okay,\" said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet. \"You'll be all right, Harry,\" said Tonks, patting him on the arm. \"Good luck,\" said Lupin. \"I'm sure it will be fine.\" \"And if it's not,\" said Sirius grimly, \"I'll see to Amelia Bones for you. . . .\" Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him. \"We've all got our fingers crossed,\" she said. \"Right,\" said Harry. \"Well . . . see you later then.\" He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear Sirius's mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn. \"You don't normally walk to work, do you?\" Harry asked him, as they set off briskly around the square. \"No, I usually Apparate,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"but obviously you can't, and I think it's best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . makes a better impression, given what you're being disciplined for. . . .\" Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Underground station they found it already full of early morning commuters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm. \"Simply fabulous,\" he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. \"Wonderfully ingenious.\" \"They're out of order,\" said Harry, pointing at the sign. \"Yes, but even so . . .\" said Mr. Weasley, beaming fondly at them. They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London. Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the Underground map above the windows. \"Four stops, Harry . . . three stops left now . . . two stops to go, Harry . . .\" They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up  the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged onto a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings, already full of traffic. \"Where are we?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley's continual references to the map; but a second later he said, \"Ah yes . . . this way, Harry,\" and led him down a side road. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I've never even used the visitor's entrance before.\" The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic. \"Here we are,\" said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffittied wall. \"After you, Harry.\" He opened the telephone box door. Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr. Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver. \"Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,\" Harry said. \"No, no, I'm sure it's fine,\" said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. \"Let's see . . . six . . .\" he dialed the number, \"two . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another two . . .\" As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr. Weasley's hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them. \"Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.\" \"Er . . .\" said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he should talk into the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, \"Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing. . . .\" \"Thank you,\" said the cool female voice. \"Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes.\" There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: It was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again. \"Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.\" The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes from watering. \"The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,\" said the woman's voice. The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open. They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and changing like some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart. Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat, and each of the house-elf's ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall. \"This way,\" said Mr. Weasley. They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, others battered briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as they walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A small, smudged sign beside it read: All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries If I'm not expelled from Hogwarts, I'll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately. \"Over here, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying security. A badly shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet. \"I'm escorting a visitor,\" said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry. \"Step over here,\" said the wizard in a bored voice. Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry's front and back. \"Wand,\" grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand. Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it. \"Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That correct?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry nervously. \"I keep this,\" said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike. \"You get this back,\" he added, thrusting the wand at Harry. \"Thank you.\" \"Hang on. . . .\" said the wizard slowly. His eyes had darted from the silver visitor's badge on Harry's chest to his forehead. \"Thank you, Eric,\" said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the shoulder, he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates. Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around one of them. A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises. \"All right, Arthur?\" said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley. \"What've you got there, Bob?\" asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the box. \"We're not sure,\" said the wizard seriously. \"We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.\" With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley moved inside it with the rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against the back wall of the lift. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone's eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling all the while, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again. \"Level seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.\" The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls; one of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upward again, and the woman's voice said, \"Level six, Department of Magical Transport, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Center.\" Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several paper airplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet color and he could see ministry of magic stamped along the edges of their wings. \"Just Interdepartmental memos,\" Mr. Weasley muttered to him. \"We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings all over the desks . . .\" As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped around the swaying lamp in the lift's ceiling. \"Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.\" When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they darted around it. \"Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.\" \" 'S'cuse,\" said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet again. \"Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.\" Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the ground. The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors opened and the voice said, \"Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.\" \"This is us, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. \"My office is on the other side of the floor.\" \"Mr. Weasley,\" said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, \"aren't we underground?\" \"Yes, we are,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"those are enchanted windows; Magical Maintenance decide what weather we're getting every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay raise. . . . Just round here, Harry.\" They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors, and emerged in a cluttered, open area divided into cubicles, which were buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquarters. Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill's was sitting with his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther along, a witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt. \"Morning, Weasley,\" said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. \"I've been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?\" \"Yes, if it really is a second,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"I'm in rather a hurry.\" They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle. Harry received a slight shock; Sirius's face was blinking down at him from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs — even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters' wedding — papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels. \"Here,\" said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand, \"I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We've received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.\" Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, \"Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.\" Then he said in normal tones, \"And don't take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.\" \"If you had read my report you would know that the term is 'firearms,' \" said Mr. Weasley coolly. \"And I'm afraid you'll have to wait for information on motorcycles, we're extremely busy at the moment.\" He dropped his voice and said, \"If you can get away before seven, Molly's making meatballs.\" He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley's cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artifacts. Mr. Weasley's dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley's obsessions; there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children's books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug. Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley's overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it. \"We haven't got a window,\" said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. \"We've asked, but they don't seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesn't look as if Perkins is in yet.\" Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins's desk while Mr. Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shackle-bolt had given him. \"Ah,\" he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst, \"yes . . .\" He flicked through it. \"Yes, he's right, I'm sure Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear, what's this now?\" A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and read aloud, \" 'Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately.' This is getting ridiculous. . . .\" \"A regurgitating toilet?\" \"Anti-Muggle pranksters,\" said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \"We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing — well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those — those pumbles, I think they're called — you know, the ones who mend pipes and things —\" \"Plumbers?\" \"— exactly, yes, but of course they're flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever's doing it.\" \"Will it be Aurors who catch them?\" \"Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol — ah, Harry, this is Perkins.\" A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room, panting. \"Oh Arthur!\" he said desperately, without looking at Harry. \"Thank goodness, I didn't know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not, I've just sent an owl to your home but you've obviously missed it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago —\" \"I know about the regurgitating toilet,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"No, no, it's not the toilet, it's the Potter boy's hearing — they've changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o'clock now and it's down in old Courtroom Ten —\" \"Down in old — but they told me — Merlin's beard —\" Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his chair. \"Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!\" Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley left the office at a run, Harry on his heels. \"Why have they changed the time?\" Harry said breathlessly as they hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at Perkins's desk. \"I've no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you'd missed it it would have been catastrophic!\" Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button. \"Come ON!\" The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button. \"Those courtrooms haven't been used in years,\" said Mr. Weasley angrily. \"I can't think why they're doing it down there — unless — but no . . .\" A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment, and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate. \"The Atrium,\" said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face got in. \"Morning, Arthur,\" he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend. \"Don't often see you down here. . . .\" \"Urgent business, Bode,\" said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry. \"Ah, yes,\" said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. \"Of course.\" Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable. \"Department of Mysteries,\" said the cool female voice, and left it at that. \"Quick, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps. \"Down here, down here,\" panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at a time. \"The lift doesn't even come down this far . . . why they're doing it there . . .\" They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor, which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape's dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets. The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes. \"Courtroom . . . ten . . . I think . . . we're nearly . . . yes.\" Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest. \"Go on,\" he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. \"Get in there.\" \"Aren't — aren't you coming with — ?\" \"No, no, I'm not allowed. Good luck!\" Harry's heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam's apple. He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped inside the courtroom.\n",

      "The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. \"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\" he told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\" \"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn't as bad as usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years. That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. \"What's this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. \"Your new school uniform,\" she said. Harry looked in the bowl again. \"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn't realize it had to be so wet.\" \"Don't be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished.\" Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. \"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. \"Make Harry get it.\" \"Get the mail, Harry.\" \"Make Dudley get it.\" \"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\" Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. \"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. \"Marge's ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk . . .\" \"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry's got something!\" Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. \"That's mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \"Who'd be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. \"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped. Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \"Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!\" They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. \"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. \"I want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it's mine.\" \"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. Harry didn't move. \"I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted. \"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley. \"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. \"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?\" \"Watching — spying — might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't want —\" Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. \"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer. . . . Yes, that's best . . . we won't do anything. . . .\" \"But —\" \"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\" That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. \"Where's my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who's writing to me?\" \"No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly. \"I have burned it.\" \"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\" \"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. \"Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking . . . you're really getting a bit big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.\" \"Why?\" said Harry. \"Don't ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs, now.\" The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched. From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \"I don't want him in there . . . I need that room . . . make him get out. . . .\" Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —' \" With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand. \"Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley — go — just go.\" Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan. The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door — \"AAAAARRRGH!\" Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. \"I want —\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didn't go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. \"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can't deliver them they'll just give up.\" \"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon.\" \"Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" as he worked, and jumped at small noises. On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. \"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in amazement. On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today —\" Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one — \"Out! OUT!\" Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. \"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \"I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\" He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake 'em off . . . shake 'em off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this. They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering. . . . They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. \" 'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk.\" She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. \"I'll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. \"Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. \"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. \"It's Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto's on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\" Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every day. Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought. \"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\" It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. \"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \"And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\" A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \"I've already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\" It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully. He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all. As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce  wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow. Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . twenty . . . ten . . . nine — maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . . BOOM. The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\n",
