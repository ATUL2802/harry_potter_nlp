      "THE BOY WHO LIVED\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that. \n",
      "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. \n",
      "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. \n",
      "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive. \n",
      "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. \n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something . . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \n",
      "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop- ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. \n",
      "He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \n",
      "\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard —\" \n",
      "\"— yes, their son, Harry —\" \n",
      "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. \n",
      "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It  might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her — if he'd had a sister like that . . . but all the same, those people in cloaks . . . \n",
      "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\" \n",
      "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. \n",
      "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. \n",
      "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw — and it didn't improve his mood — was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \n",
      "\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. \n",
      "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \n",
      "\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\" \n",
      "\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\" \n",
      "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . . Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er — Petunia, dear — you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\" \n",
      "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister. \n",
      "\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\" \n",
      "\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today . . .\" \n",
      "\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley. \n",
      "\"Well, I just thought . . . maybe . . . it was something to do with . . . you know . . . her crowd.\" \n",
      "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son — he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\" \n",
      "\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \n",
      "\"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?\" \n",
      "\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree.\" \n",
      "He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. \n",
      "Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did . . . if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn't think he could bear it. \n",
      "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn't affect them. . . . \n",
      "How very wrong he was. \n",
      "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. \n",
      "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. \n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\" \n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. \n",
      "\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\" \n",
      "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. \n",
      "\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked. \n",
      "\"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\" \"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall. \n",
      "\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \n",
      "\"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no — even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls . . . shooting stars. . . . Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\" \n",
      "\"You can't blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\" \n",
      "\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\" \n",
      "She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\" \n",
      "\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\" \n",
      "\"A what?\" \n",
      "\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.\" \"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone —\" \n",
      "\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You-Know-Who' nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.\" \n",
      "\"I know you haven't,\" said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\" \n",
      "\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\" \n",
      "\"Only because you're too — well — noble to use them.\" \n",
      "\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\" \n",
      "It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. \n",
      "\"What they're saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that they're — dead.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. \n",
      "\"Lily and James . . . I can't believe it . . . I didn't want to believe it . . . Oh, Albus . . .\" \n",
      "Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know . . . I know . . .\" he said heavily. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \"That's not all. They're saying he tried to kill the Potters' son, Harry. But — he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke — and that's why he's gone.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore nodded glumly. \n",
      "\"It's — it's true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he's done . . . all the people he's killed . . . he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\" \n",
      "\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have  made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?\" \n",
      "\"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now.\" \n",
      "\"You don't mean — you can't mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \"Dumbledore — you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\" \n",
      "\"It's the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter.\" \n",
      "\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous — a legend — I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!\" \n",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can't you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind,  swallowed, and then said, \"Yes — yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. \n",
      "\"Hagrid's bringing him.\" \n",
      "\"You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\" \n",
      "\"I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore. \n",
      "\"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to — what was that?\" \n",
      "A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. \n",
      "If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. \n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\" \n",
      "\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've got him, sir.\" \"No problems, were there?\" \n",
      "\"No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. \n",
      "\"Is that where — ?\" whispered Professor McGonagall. \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He'll have that scar forever.\" \n",
      "\"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\" \n",
      "\"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we'd better get this over with.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house. \n",
      "\"Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. \n",
      "\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you'll wake the Muggles!\" \n",
      "\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can't stand it — Lily an' James dead — an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles —\" \n",
      "\"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out. \n",
      "\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that's that. We've no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\" \n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I'd best get this bike away. G'night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.\" \n",
      "Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. \n",
      "\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. \n",
      "Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. \n",
      "\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . . He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THE VANISHING GLASS\n",
      "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \n",
      "\"Up! Get up! Now!\" \n",
      "Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \n",
      "\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. \n",
      "His aunt was back outside the door. \n",
      "\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \n",
      "\"Nearly,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\" \n",
      "Harry groaned. \n",
      "\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \n",
      "\"Nothing, nothing . . .\" \n",
      "Dudley's birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. \n",
      "When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he  wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. \n",
      "Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \n",
      "\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\" \n",
      "Don't ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \n",
      "\"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. \n",
      "About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put  together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. \n",
      "Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. \n",
      "Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \n",
      "\"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\" \n",
      "\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. \n",
      "Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\" \n",
      "Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty . . . thirty . . .\" \n",
      "\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \n",
      "\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair. \n",
      "At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \n",
      "\"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction. \n",
      "Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. \n",
      "\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \n",
      "\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \n",
      "\"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" \n",
      "The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. \n",
      "\"What about what's-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \n",
      "\"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). \n",
      "Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. \n",
      "\"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \n",
      "\"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \". . . and leave him in the car. . . .\" \n",
      "\"That cars new, he's not sitting in it alone. . . .\" \n",
      "Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying — it had been years since he'd really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \n",
      "\"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \n",
      "\"I . . . don't . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. \n",
      "Just then, the doorbell rang — \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. \n",
      "Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \n",
      "\"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" \n",
      "I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly . . .\" \n",
      "But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. \n",
      "The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. \n",
      "Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. \n",
      "Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. \n",
      "On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. \n",
      "But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. \n",
      "While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \n",
      "\". . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \n",
      "\"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\" \n",
      "Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don't,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" \n",
      "But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. \n",
      "It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. \n",
      "Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. \n",
      "Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. \n",
      "After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. \n",
      "Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \n",
      "\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. \n",
      "\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \n",
      "\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. \n",
      "Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. \n",
      "The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. \n",
      "It winked. \n",
      "Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. \n",
      "The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \n",
      "\"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" \n",
      "The snake nodded vigorously. \n",
      "\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. \n",
      "The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. \n",
      "Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \n",
      "\"Was it nice there?\" \n",
      "The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see — so you've never been to Brazil?\" \n",
      "As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\" \n",
      "Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \n",
      "\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. \n",
      "Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. \n",
      "As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.\" \n",
      "The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" \n",
      "The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. \n",
      "Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. \n",
      "He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He  couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. \n",
      "When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. \n",
      "At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n",
      "The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. \n",
      "\"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\" he told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\" \n",
      "\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said. \n",
      "One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn't as bad as usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years. \n",
      "That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. \n",
      "As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. \n",
      "There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. \n",
      "\"What's this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. \n",
      "\"Your new school uniform,\" she said. \n",
      "Harry looked in the bowl again. \n",
      "\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn't realize it had to be so wet.\" \n",
      "\"Don't be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished.\" \n",
      "Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. \n",
      "Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. \n",
      "They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. \n",
      "\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. \n",
      "\"Make Harry get it.\" \n",
      "\"Get the mail, Harry.\" \n",
      "\"Make Dudley get it.\" \n",
      "\"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\" Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. \n",
      "Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: \n",
      "Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey \n",
      "The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. \n",
      "Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. \n",
      "\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke. \n",
      "Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. \n",
      "\"Marge's ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk . . .\" \n",
      "\"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry's got something!\" \n",
      "Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. \n",
      "\"That's mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \n",
      "\"Who'd be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. \n",
      "\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped. \n",
      "Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \n",
      "\"Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!\" \n",
      "They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. \n",
      "\"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. \n",
      "\"I want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it's mine.\" \n",
      "\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. \n",
      "Harry didn't move. \n",
      "\"I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted. \"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley. \n",
      "\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. \n",
      "\"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?\" \n",
      "\"Watching — spying — might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \n",
      "\"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't want —\" \n",
      "Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. \n",
      "\"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer. . . . Yes, that's best . . . we won't do anything. . . .\" \n",
      "\"But —\" \n",
      "\"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\" \n",
      "That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. \n",
      "\"Where's my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who's writing to me?\" \n",
      "\"No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly. \"I have burned it.\" \n",
      "\"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\" \n",
      "\"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. \n",
      "\"Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking . . . you're really getting a bit big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.\" \n",
      "\"Why?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Don't ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs, now.\" \n",
      "The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched. \n",
      "From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \"I don't want him in there . . . I need that room . . . make him get out. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. \n",
      "Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. \n",
      "When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —' \" \n",
      "With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand. \n",
      "\"Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley — go — just go.\" \n",
      "Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan. \n",
      "The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. \n",
      "He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door — \n",
      "\"AAAAARRRGH!\" \n",
      "Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive! \n",
      "Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. \n",
      "\"I want —\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didn't go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. \n",
      "\"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can't deliver them they'll just give up.\" \n",
      "\"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. \n",
      "On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" as he worked, and jumped at small noises. \n",
      "On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. \n",
      "\"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in amazement. \n",
      "On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \n",
      "\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today —\" \n",
      "Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one — \n",
      "\"Out! OUT!\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. \n",
      "\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \"I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\" \n",
      "He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. \n",
      "They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake 'em off . . . shake 'em off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this. \n",
      "They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering. . . . \n",
      "They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. \n",
      "\" 'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk.\" \n",
      "She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: \n",
      "Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth \n",
      "Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. \n",
      "\"I'll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. \n",
      "\"Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. \n",
      "\"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. \n",
      "It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. \n",
      "\"It's Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto's on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\" \n",
      "Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every day. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought. \n",
      "\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\" \n",
      "It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. \n",
      "\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \"And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\" \n",
      "A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \n",
      "\"I've already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\" \n",
      "It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. \n",
      "The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \n",
      "\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully. \n",
      "He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all. \n",
      "As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce  \n",
      "wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. \n",
      "The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. \n",
      "Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow. \n",
      "Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? \n",
      "One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . twenty . . . ten . . . nine — maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . . \n",
      "BOOM. \n",
      "The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n",
      "BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where's the cannon?\" he said stupidly. There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands — now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. \"Who's there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you — I'm armed!\" There was a pause. Then — SMASH! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. \n",
      "\"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy journey. . . .\" \n",
      "He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. \n",
      "\"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger. \n",
      "Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \n",
      "\"An' here's Harry!\" said the giant. \n",
      "Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \n",
      "\"Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh've got yer mom's eyes.\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \n",
      "\"I demand that you leave at once, sir!\" he said. \"You are breaking and entering!\" \n",
      "\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. \n",
      "\"Anyway — Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right.\" \n",
      "From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly  squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. \n",
      "Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\" \n",
      "The giant chuckled. \n",
      "\"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm. \n",
      "\"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.\" \n",
      "His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath. \n",
      "The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \"Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\" \n",
      "The giant chuckled darkly. \"Yer great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don' worry.\" \n",
      "He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \"I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.\" \n",
      "The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \n",
      "\"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh'll know all about Hog-warts, o' course.\" \n",
      "\"Er — no,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Hagrid looked shocked. \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly. \n",
      "\"Sorry?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \"It's them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?\" \n",
      "\"All what?\" asked Harry. \n",
      "\"ALL WHAT?\" Hagrid thundered. \"Now wait jus' one second!\" \n",
      "He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. \n",
      "\"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin' abou' — about ANYTHING?\" \n",
      "Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad. \n",
      "\"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\" But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \"About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents' world.\" \n",
      "\"What world?\" \n",
      "Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \n",
      "\"DURSLEY!\" he boomed. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \"Mimblewimble.\" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. \n",
      "\"But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they're famous. You're famous.\" \n",
      "\"What? My — my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?\" \n",
      "\"Yeh don' know . . . yeh don' know . . .\" Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. \n",
      "\"Yeh don' know what yeh are?\" he said finally. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. \n",
      "\"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\" \n",
      "A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. \n",
      "\"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An' you've kept it from him all these years?\" \n",
      "\"Kept what from me?\" said Harry eagerly. \n",
      "\"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. \n",
      "Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \n",
      "\"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry — yer a wizard.\" \n",
      "There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. \"I'm a what?\" gasped Harry. \n",
      "\"A wizard, o' course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \"an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.\" \n",
      "Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: \n",
      "HOGWARTS SCHOOL \n",
      "of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY \n",
      "Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore \n",
      "(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, \n",
      "Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards ) \n",
      "Dear Mr. Potter, \n",
      "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. \n",
      "Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, \n",
      "Minerva McGonagall, \n",
      "Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does it mean, they await my owl?\" \n",
      "\"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: \n",
      "Dear Professor Dumbledore, \n",
      "Given Harry his letter. \n",
      "Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. \n",
      "Weather's horrible. Hope you're well. \n",
      "Hagrid \n",
      "Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. \n",
      "Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. \n",
      "\"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. \n",
      "\"He's not going,\" he said. \n",
      "Hagrid grunted. \n",
      "\"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said. \n",
      "\"A what?\" said Harry, interested. \"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it's what we call nonmagic folk like them. An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\" \n",
      "\"We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\" \n",
      "\"You knew?\" said Harry. \"You knew I'm a — a wizard?\" \n",
      "\"Knew!\" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \"Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\" \n",
      "She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. \n",
      "\"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\" \n",
      "Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\" \n",
      "\"CAR CRASH!\" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \"How could a car crash kill Lily an' James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\" \"But why? What happened?\" Harry asked urgently. \n",
      "The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious. \n",
      "\"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right person ter tell yeh — but someone's gotta — yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin'.\" \n",
      "He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \n",
      "\"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it. . . .\" \n",
      "He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \"It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows —\" \n",
      "\"Who?\" \n",
      "\"Well — I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does.\" \n",
      "\"Why not?\" \n",
      "\"Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . .\" \n",
      "Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. \n",
      "\"Could you write it down?\" Harry suggested. \n",
      "\"Nah — can't spell it. All right — Voldemort.\" Hagrid shuddered. \"Don' make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too — some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up to him — an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway. \n",
      "\"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the mys-t'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before . . . probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the Dark Side. \n",
      "\"Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em . . . maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an' — an' —\" \n",
      "Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he said. \"But it's that sad — knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find — anyway . . . \n",
      "\"You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then — an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even — but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an' you was only a baby, an' you lived.\" \n",
      "Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind. As Hagrid's story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. \n",
      "Hagrid was watching him sadly. \n",
      "\"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . .\" \n",
      "\"Load of old tosh,\" said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Ha-grid and his fists were clenched. \n",
      "\"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end —\" \n",
      "But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \"I'm warning you, Dursley — I'm warning you — one more word . . .\" \n",
      "In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. \"That's better,\" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. \n",
      "Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. \n",
      "\"But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?\" \n",
      "\"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see . . . he was gettin' more an' more powerful — why'd he go? \n",
      "\"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don' reckon they could've done if he was comin' back. \n",
      "\"Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin' about you stumped him, all right.\" \n",
      "Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? \"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I don't think I can be a wizard.\" \n",
      "To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \n",
      "\"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\" \n",
      "Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry . . . chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach . . . dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him? \n",
      "Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. \n",
      "\"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight. \n",
      "\"Haven't I told you he's not going?\" he hissed. \"He's going to Stonewall High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —\" \n",
      "\"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him,\" growled Hagrid. \"Stop Lily an' James Potter's son goin' ter Hog-warts! Yer mad. His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled—\" \"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\" yelled Uncle Vernon. \n",
      "But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \"NEVER —\" he thundered, \"— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!\" \n",
      "He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. \n",
      "Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. \n",
      "\"Shouldn'ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn't work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do.\" \n",
      "He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. \n",
      "\"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he said. \"I'm — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff — one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job —\" \n",
      "\"Why aren't you supposed to do magic?\" asked Harry. \n",
      "\"Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\" \"Why were you expelled?\" \n",
      "\"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow,\" said Hagrid loudly. \"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that.\" \n",
      "He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. \n",
      "\"You can kip under that,\" he said. \"Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "DIAGON ALLEY\n",
      "Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. \"It was a dream,\" he told himself firmly. \"I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard.\" There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap. Tap. \"All right,\" Harry mumbled, \"I'm getting up.\" He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat. \n",
      "\"Don't do that.\" \n",
      "Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. \n",
      "\"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There's an owl —\" \n",
      "\"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \n",
      "\"What?\" \n",
      "\"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets.\" \n",
      "Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags . . . finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \n",
      "\"Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily. \n",
      "\"Knuts?\" \n",
      "\"The little bronze ones.\" \n",
      "Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. \n",
      "Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \n",
      "\"Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school.\" \n",
      "Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. \"Um — Hagrid?\" \n",
      "\"Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. \n",
      "\"I haven't got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night . . . he won't pay for me to go and learn magic.\" \n",
      "\"Don't worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \"D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?\" \n",
      "\"But if their house was destroyed —\" \n",
      "\"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold — an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither.\" \n",
      "\"Wizards have banks?\" \n",
      "\"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\" \n",
      "Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \n",
      "\"Goblins?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah — so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe — 'cept maybe Hog-warts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \"He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you — gettin' things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see. \n",
      "\"Got everythin'? Come on, then.\" \n",
      "Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. \n",
      "\"How did you get here?\" Harry asked, looking around for another boat. \"Flew,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "\"Flew?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah — but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh.\" \n",
      "They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. \n",
      "\"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \"If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?\" \n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. \n",
      "\"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\" Harry asked. \n",
      "\"Spells — enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \"They say there's dragons guardin' the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\" \n",
      "Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions in his life. \n",
      "\"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered, turning the page. \n",
      "\"There's a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop himself. \n",
      "\" 'Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o' course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice.\" \n",
      "\"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\" \n",
      "\"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country.\" \n",
      "\"Why?\" \n",
      "\"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we're best left alone.\" \n",
      "At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. \n",
      "Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Ha-grid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\" \n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\" \n",
      "\"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I'd like a dragon.\" \n",
      "\"You'd like one?\" \n",
      "\"Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.\" \n",
      "They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand \"Muggle money,\" as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. \n",
      "People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. \n",
      "\"Still got yer letter, Harry?\" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \n",
      "\"Good,\" said Hagrid. \"There's a list there of everything yeh need.\" \n",
      "Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night before, and read: \n",

      "\"Can we buy all this in London?\" Harry wondered aloud. \"If yeh know where to go,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. \n",
      "\"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. \n",
      "Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry  had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him. \n",
      "\"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron. It's a famous place.\" \n",
      "It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Ha-grid had steered him inside. \n",
      "For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\" \"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle. \n",
      "\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this — can this be — ?\" \n",
      "The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. \n",
      "\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter . . . what an honor.\" \n",
      "He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \n",
      "\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\" \n",
      "Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. \n",
      "Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. \n",
      "\"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last.\" \n",
      "\"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud.\" \n",
      "\"Always wanted to shake your hand — I'm all of a flutter.\" \n",
      "\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle.\" \n",
      "\"I've seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\" \n",
      "\"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. \n",
      "A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. \n",
      "\"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, \"c-can't t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\" \n",
      "\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\" \n",
      "\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought. \n",
      "But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. \n",
      "\"Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\" \n",
      "Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. \n",
      "Hagrid grinned at Harry. \n",
      "\"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh — mind you, he's usually tremblin'.\" \n",
      "\"Is he always that nervous?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience. . . . They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject — now, where's me umbrella?\" \n",
      "Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. \n",
      "\"Three up . . . two across . . .\" he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\" \n",
      "He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. \n",
      "The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Ha-grid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. \n",
      "\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\" \n",
      "He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. \n",
      "The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \n",
      "\"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first.\" \n",
      "Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they're mad. \n",
      "A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon. . . . \n",
      "\"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was — \n",
      "\"Yeah, that's a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: \n",
      "Enter, stranger, but take heed \n",
      "Of what awaits the sin of greed, \n",
      "For those who take, but do not earn, \n",
      "Must pay most dearly in their turn. \n",
      "So if you seek beneath our floors \n",
      "A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware \n",
      "Of finding more than treasure there. \n",
      "\"Like I said, yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. \n",
      "\"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe.\" \n",
      "\"You have his key, sir?\" \n",
      "\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. \n",
      "\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. \n",
      "The goblin looked at it closely. \n",
      "\"That seems to be in order.\" \n",
      "\"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It's about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\" \n",
      "The goblin read the letter carefully. \n",
      "\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\" \n",
      "Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. \n",
      "\"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry asked. \n",
      "\"Can't tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that.\" \n",
      "Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off. \n",
      "At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering. \n",
      "Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \n",
      "\"I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\" \n",
      "\"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick.\" He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. \n",
      "Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \n",
      "\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid. \n",
      "All Harry's — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. \n",
      "Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \n",
      "\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\" \n",
      "\"One speed only,\" said Griphook. \n",
      "They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Ha-grid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. \n",
      "Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \n",
      "\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. \"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook. \n",
      "\"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?\" Harry asked. \n",
      "\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. \n",
      "Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. \n",
      "\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had. \n",
      "\"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous. \n",
      "Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. \"Hogwarts, dear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\" \n",
      "In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. \n",
      "\"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \"Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow.\" \n",
      "Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \n",
      "\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on. \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Play Quidditch at all?\" \n",
      "\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. \n",
      "\"I do — Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you'll be in yet?\" \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \n",
      "\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. \n",
      "\"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in. \n",
      "\"That's Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't. \"He works at Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?\" \n",
      "\"He's the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. \n",
      "\"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\" \n",
      "\"I think he's brilliant,\" said Harry coldly. \n",
      "\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where are your parents?\" \n",
      "\"They're dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy. \n",
      "\"Oh, sorry,\" said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were our kind, weren't they?\" \n",
      "\"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean.\" \n",
      "\"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname, anyway?\" \n",
      "But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That's  you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. \n",
      "\"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy. \n",
      "Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). \n",
      "\"What's up?\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what's Quidditch?\" \n",
      "\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know — not knowin' about Quidditch!\" \n",
      "\"Don't make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin's. \n",
      "\"— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in —\" \n",
      "\"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were — he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in 'em in a long line o' Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\" \n",
      "\"So what is Quidditch?\" \n",
      "\"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.\" \"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\" \n",
      "\"School Houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but —\" \n",
      "\"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff,\" said Harry gloomily. \n",
      "\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\" \n",
      "\"Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\" \n",
      "\"Years an' years ago,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. \n",
      "\"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\" \n",
      "\"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\" \n",
      "Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says pewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up  for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). \n",
      "Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again. \n",
      "\"Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday present.\" \n",
      "Harry felt himself go red. \n",
      "\"You don't have to —\" \n",
      "\"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at — an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'.\" \n",
      "Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \n",
      "\"Don' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\" \n",
      "A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 b.c. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. \n",
      "A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. \n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. \n",
      "An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. \n",
      "\"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly. \n",
      "\"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\" It wasn't a question. \"You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\" \n",
      "Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \n",
      "\"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\" Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. \n",
      "\"And that's where . . .\" \n",
      "Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger. \n",
      "\"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly. \"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands . . . well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do. . . .\" \n",
      "He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid. \n",
      "\"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?\" \n",
      "\"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "\"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. \n",
      "\"Er — yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \"I've still got the pieces, though,\" he added brightly. \n",
      "\"But you don't use them?\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply. \n",
      "\"Oh, no, sir,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \n",
      "\"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.\" He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \"Which is your wand arm?\" \n",
      "\"Er — well, I'm right-handed,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Hold out your arm. That's it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander  wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand.\" \n",
      "Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. \n",
      "\"That will do,\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.\" \n",
      "Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. \n",
      "\"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches.  Quite whippy. Try —\" \n",
      "Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. \n",
      "\"No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\" \n",
      "Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. \n",
      "\"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\" Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well . . . how curious . . . how very curious . . .\" \n",
      "He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \"Curious . . . curious . . .\" \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what's curious?\" \n",
      "Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \n",
      "\"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.\" \n",
      "Harry swallowed. \n",
      "\"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.\" \n",
      "Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. \n",
      "The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Ha-grid tapped him on the shoulder. \n",
      "\"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said. \n",
      "He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. \n",
      "\"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. \n",
      "\"Everyone thinks I'm special,\" he said at last. \"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander . . . but I don't know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.\" \n",
      "Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \n",
      "\"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it's hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, 'smatter of fact.\" Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. \n",
      "\"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,\" he said. \"First o' September — King's Cross — it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me. . . . See yeh soon, Harry.\" \n",
      "The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Ha-grid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\n",
      "Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn't speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off  \n",
      "another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. \n",
      "On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. \n",
      "\"Er — Uncle Vernon?\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \n",
      "\"Er — I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon grunted again. \n",
      "\"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\" \n",
      "Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \n",
      "\"Thank you.\" \n",
      "He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. \n",
      "\"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\" \n",
      "Harry didn't say anything. \n",
      "\"Where is this school, anyway?\" \n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. \n",
      "\"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock,\" he read. \n",
      "His aunt and uncle stared. \n",
      "\"Platform what?\" \n",
      "\"Nine and three-quarters.\" \"Don't talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and three-quarters.\" \n",
      "\"It's on my ticket.\" \n",
      "\"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see. You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.\" \n",
      "\"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. \n",
      "\"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\" \n",
      "Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes — he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. \n",
      "They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \n",
      "\"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?\" \n",
      "He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. \n",
      "\"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone. \n",
      "He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hog-warts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. \n",
      "Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten. \n",
      "At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. \n",
      "\"— packed with Muggles, of course —\" Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him — and they had an owl. \n",
      "Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. \n",
      "\"Now, what's the platform number?\" said the boys' mother. \n",
      "\"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, \"Mom, can't I go . . .\" \n",
      "\"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\" \n",
      "What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. \n",
      "\"Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said. \n",
      "\"I'm not Fred, I'm George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can't you tell I'm George?\" \n",
      "\"Sorry, George, dear.\" \n",
      "\"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it? \n",
      "Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier — he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere. \n",
      "There was nothing else for it. \n",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman. \n",
      "\"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too.\" \n",
      "She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is — the thing is, I don't know how to —\" \n",
      "\"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded. \n",
      "\"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\" \n",
      "\"Er — okay,\" said Harry. \n",
      "He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. \n",
      "He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn't be able to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — \n",
      "It didn't come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes. \n",
      "A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway  where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it. He had done it. \n",
      "Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. \n",
      "The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I've lost my toad again.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh. \n",
      "A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. \n",
      "\"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\" \n",
      "The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. \n",
      "Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \n",
      "\"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier. \n",
      "\"Yes, please,\" Harry panted. \n",
      "\"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!\" \n",
      "With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. \n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. \n",
      "\"What's that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar. \n",
      "\"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you — ?\" \n",
      "\"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren't you?\" he added to Harry. \n",
      "\"What?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" chorused the twins. \n",
      "\"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\" \n",
      "The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door. \n",
      "\"Fred? George? Are you there?\" \n",
      "\"Coming, Mom.\" \n",
      "With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. \n",
      "Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. \n",
      "\"Ron, you've got something on your nose.\" \n",
      "The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. \n",
      "\"Mom — geroff.\" He wriggled free. \n",
      "\"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the twins. \n",
      "\"Shut up,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Where's Percy?\" said their mother. \n",
      "\"He's coming now.\" \n",
      "The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it. \n",
      "\"Can't stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves —\" \n",
      "\"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\" \n",
      "\"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the other twin. \"Once —\" \n",
      "\"Or twice —\" \n",
      "\"A minute —\" \n",
      "\"All summer —\" \n",
      "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect. \n",
      "\"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins. \n",
      "\"Because he's a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.\" \n",
      "She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. \n",
      "\"Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've — you've blown up a toilet or —\" \n",
      "\"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.\" \n",
      "\"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\" \n",
      "\"It's not funny. And look after Ron.\" \n",
      "\"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\" \n",
      "\"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. \n",
      "\"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\" \n",
      "Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking. \n",
      "\"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\" \n",
      "\"Who?\" \n",
      "\"Harry Potter!\" \n",
      "Harry heard the little girl's voice. \n",
      "\"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, oh please. . . .\" \n",
      "\"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\" \n",
      "\"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there — like lightning.\" \n",
      "\"Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\" \n",
      "\"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\" \n",
      "Their mother suddenly became very stern. \n",
      "\"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\" \n",
      "\"All right, keep your hair on.\" \n",
      "A whistle sounded. \n",
      "\"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. \n",
      "\"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls.\" \n",
      "\"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\" \n",
      "\"George!\" \n",
      "\"Only joking, Mom.\" \n",
      "The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving  and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. \n",
      "Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn't know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. \n",
      "The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. \n",
      "\"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \"Everywhere else is full.\" \n",
      "Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. \n",
      "\"Hey, Ron.\" \n",
      "The twins were back. \n",
      "\"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there.\" \n",
      "\"Right,\" mumbled Ron. \n",
      "\"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\" \n",
      "\"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. \n",
      "\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out. \n",
      "Harry nodded. \n",
      "\"Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got — you know . . .\" \n",
      "He pointed at Harry's forehead. \n",
      "Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. \n",
      "\"So that's where You-Know-Who — ?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can't remember it.\" \n",
      "\"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly. \n",
      "\"Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\" \n",
      "\"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. \n",
      "\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. \n",
      "\"Er — yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.\" \n",
      "\"So you must know loads of magic already.\" \n",
      "The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. \n",
      "\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\" \n",
      "\"Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.\" \n",
      "\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.\" \n",
      "Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. \n",
      "\"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff— I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\" \n",
      "Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. \n",
      "Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. \n",
      "\". . . and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort —\" \n",
      "Ron gasped. \n",
      "\"What?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"You said You-Know-Who's name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I'd have thought you, of all people —\" \n",
      "\"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, \"I just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to learn. . . . I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I'm the worst in the class.\" \n",
      "\"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\" \n",
      "While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and \n",
      "sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. \n",
      "Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears?\" \n",
      "Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. \n",
      "He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. \n",
      "Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \n",
      "\"Hungry, are you?\" \n",
      "\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. \n",
      "Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She always forgets I don't like corned beef.\" \n",
      "\"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on —\" \n",
      "\"You don't want this, it's all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn't got much time,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\" \"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \n",
      "\"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \"They're not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. \n",
      "\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.\" \n",
      "\"What?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know — Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\" \n",
      "Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man's face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. \n",
      "\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —\" \n",
      "Harry turned over his card and read: \n",
      "ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \n",
      "currently headmaster of hogwarts \n",
      "Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, \n",
      "Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the  \n",
      "Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. \n",
      "Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that \n",
      "Dumbledore's face had disappeared. \n",
      "\"He's gone!\" \n",
      "\"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He'll be back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her . . . do you want it? You can start collecting.\" \n",
      "Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. \n",
      "\"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\" \n",
      "\"Do they? What, they don't move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed. \"Weird!\" \n",
      "Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. \n",
      "\"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\" \n",
      "Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. \n",
      "\"Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.\" \n",
      "They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper. \n",
      "The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. \n",
      "There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful. \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\" \n",
      "When they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\" \n",
      "\"He'll turn up,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him . . .\" \n",
      "He left. \n",
      "\"Don't know why he's so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk.\" \n",
      "The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap. \n",
      "\"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look . . .\" \n",
      "He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. \n",
      "\"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway —\" \n",
      "He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. \n",
      "\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. \n",
      "\"We've already told him we haven't seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. \n",
      "\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.\" \n",
      "She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \n",
      "\"Er — all right.\" \n",
      "He cleared his throat. \n",
      "\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\" \n",
      "He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. \n",
      "\"Are you sure that's a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard — I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it  will be enough — I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are \n",
      "you?\" \n",
      "She said all this very fast. \n",
      "Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either. \n",
      "\"I'm Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\" \n",
      "\"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed. \n",
      "\"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad. . . . Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.\" \n",
      "And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \n",
      "\"Whatever House I'm in, I hope she's not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\" \n",
      "\"What House are your brothers in?\" asked Harry. \n",
      "\"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\" \n",
      "\"That's the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. \n",
      "\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,\" said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off Houses. \"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?\" \n",
      "Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school. \n",
      "\"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.\" \n",
      "Harry stared. \n",
      "\"Really? What happened to them?\" \n",
      "\"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it.\" \n",
      "Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying. \n",
      "\"What's your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked. \n",
      "\"Er — I don't know any,\" Harry confessed. \n",
      "\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world —\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. \n",
      "Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley. \n",
      "\"Is it true?\" he said. \"They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. \n",
      "\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \"And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\" \n",
      "Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \n",
      "\"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\" \n",
      "He turned back to Harry. \"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\" \n",
      "He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it. \n",
      "\"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly. \n",
      "Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. \n",
      "\"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.\" \n",
      "Both Harry and Ron stood up. \n",
      "\"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair. \n",
      "\"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered. \n",
      "\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. \n",
      "\"But we don't feel like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\" \n",
      "Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. \n",
      "Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. \n",
      "\"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. \n",
      "\"I think he's been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \"No — I don't believe it — he's gone back to \n",
      "sleep.\" \n",
      "And so he had. \n",
      "\"You've met Malfoy before?\" \n",
      "Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. \n",
      "\"I've heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to Hermione. \"Can we help you with something?\" \n",
      "\"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!\" \n",
      "\"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would you mind leaving while we change?\" \n",
      "\"All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \"And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\" \n",
      "Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. \n",
      "He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. \n",
      "A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hog- \n",
      "warts in five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\" \n",
      "Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. \n",
      "The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?\" \n",
      "Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \n",
      "\"C'mon, follow me — any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!\" \n",
      "Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. \n",
      "\"Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over his shoulder, \"jus' round this bend here.\" \n",
      "There was a loud \"Oooooh!\" \n",
      "The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. \n",
      "\"No more'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \"Right then — FORWARD!\" \n",
      "And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \n",
      "\"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. \n",
      "\"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. \n",
      "\"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. \n",
      "They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. \n",
      "\"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\" \n",
      "Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE SORTING HAT\n",
      "The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross. \"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid. \"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\" She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. \n",
      "\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room. \n",
      "\"The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hog-warts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. \n",
      "\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\" \n",
      "Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. \n",
      "\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor Mc-Gonagall. \"Please wait quietly.\" \n",
      "She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \n",
      "\"How exactly do they sort us into Houses?\" he asked Ron. \"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\" \n",
      "Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. \n",
      "Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed. \n",
      "\"What the — ?\" \n",
      "He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —\" \n",
      "\"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?\" \n",
      "A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. Nobody answered. \n",
      "\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\" \n",
      "A few people nodded mutely. \n",
      "\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old House, you know.\" \n",
      "\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. \n",
      "\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\" \n",
      "Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. \n",
      "Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \"It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\" \n",
      "It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens. \n",
      "Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house. \n",
      "Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing: \n",
      "\"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, \n",
      "But don't judge on what you see, \n",
      "I'll eat myself if you can find \n",
      "A smarter hat than me. \n",
      "You can keep your bowlers black, \n",
      "Your top hats sleek and tall, \n",
      "For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat \n",
      "And I can cap them all. \n",
      "There's nothing hidden in your head \n",
      "The Sorting Hat can't see, \n",
      "So try me on and I will tell you \n",
      "Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, \n",
      "Where dwell the brave at heart, \n",
      "Their daring, nerve, and chivalry \n",
      "Set Gryffindors apart; \n",
      "You might belong in Hufflepuff, \n",
      "Where they are just and loyal, \n",
      "Those patient Hufflepuffs are true \n",
      "And unafraid of toil; \n",
      "Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, \n",
      "If you've a ready mind, \n",
      "Where those of wit and learning, \n",
      "Will always find their kind; \n",
      "Or perhaps in Slytherin \n",
      "You'll make your real friends, \n",
      "Those cunning folk use any means \n",
      "To achieve their ends. \n",
      "So put me on! Don't be afraid! \n",
      "And don't get in a flap! \n",
      "You're in safe hands (though I have none) \n",
      "For I'm a Thinking Cap!\" \n",
      "The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. \n",
      "\"So we've just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\" \n",
      "Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a  lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. \n",
      "\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\" \n",
      "A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment's pause — \n",
      "\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat. \n",
      "The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. \n",
      "\"Bones, Susan!\" \n",
      "\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \n",
      "\"Boot, Terry!\" \n",
      "\"RAVENCLAW!\" \n",
      "The table second from the left clapped this time; several Raven-claws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. \n",
      "\"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling. \n",
      "\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. \n",
      "\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\" \n",
      "\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" \n",
      "Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. \n",
      "\"Granger, Hermione!\" \n",
      "Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \n",
      "\"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned. \n",
      "A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train? \n",
      "When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\" \n",
      "Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\" Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. \n",
      "There weren't many people left now. \n",
      "\"Moon\" . . . , \"Nott\" . . . , \"Parkinson\" . . . , then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" . . . , then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" . . . , and then, at last — \n",
      "\"Potter, Harry!\" \n",
      "As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. \n",
      "\"Potter, did she say?\" \n",
      "\"The Harry Potter?\" \n",
      "The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. \n",
      "\"Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?\" \n",
      "Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. \n",
      "\"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you're sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!\" \n",
      "Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the  Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. \n",
      "He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. \n",
      "And now there were only four people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\" \n",
      "Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. \n",
      "\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. \n",
      "Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. \n",
      "\"Welcome!\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \n",
      "\"Thank you!\" \n",
      "He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. \n",
      "\"Is he — a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly. \n",
      "\"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\" \n",
      "Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. \n",
      "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. \n",
      "\"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. \n",
      "\"Can't you — ?\" \n",
      "\"I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\" \n",
      "\"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you — you're Nearly Headless Nick!\" \n",
      "\"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —\" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. \n",
      "\"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\" \n",
      "Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted. \n",
      "\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So — new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable — he's the Slytherin ghost.\" \n",
      "Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements. \n",
      "\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest. \n",
      "\"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. \n",
      "When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as be- fore. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate &eacute;clairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding . . . \n",
      "As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. \n",
      "\"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\" \n",
      "The others laughed. \n",
      "\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\" \n",
      "On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult —\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —\"). \n",
      "Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. \n",
      "It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead. \n",
      "\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head. \n",
      "\"What is it?\" asked Percy. \n",
      "\"N-nothing.\" \n",
      "The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look — a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all. \n",
      "\"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy. \n",
      "\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to — everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\" \n",
      "Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again. \n",
      "At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \n",
      "\"Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. \n",
      "\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \n",
      "\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch. \n",
      "\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\" \n",
      "Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \n",
      "\"He's not serious?\" he muttered to Percy. \n",
      "\"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere — the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\" \n",
      "\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed. \n",
      "Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. \n",
      "\"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\" And the school bellowed: \n",
      "\"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, \n",
      "Teach us something please, \n",
      "Whether we be old and bald \n",
      "Or young with scabby knees, \n",
      "Our heads could do with filling \n",
      "With some interesting stuff, \n",
      "For now they're bare and full of air, \n",
      "Dead flies and bits of fluff, \n",
      "So teach us things worth knowing, \n",
      "Bring back what we've forgot, \n",
      "Just do your best, we'll do the rest, \n",
      "And learn until our brains all rot.\" \n",
      "Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \n",
      "\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\" \n",
      "The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more  staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. \n",
      "A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. \n",
      "\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves — show yourself.\" \n",
      "A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. \n",
      "\"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\" \n",
      "There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \n",
      "\"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\" \n",
      "He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \n",
      "\"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy. \n",
      "Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \n",
      "\"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\" \n",
      "At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \n",
      "\"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. \n",
      "Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. \n",
      "\"Great food, isn't it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets.\" \n",
      "Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. \n",
      "Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. \n",
      "He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE POTIONS MASTER\n",
      "There, look.\" \"Where?\" \"Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\" \"Wearing the glasses?\" \"Did you see his face?\" \"Did you see his scar?\" Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. \n",
      "The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\" \n",
      "Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. \n",
      "Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two  seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick. \n",
      "And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. \n",
      "They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. \n",
      "Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. \n",
      "Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. \"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\" \n",
      "Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. \n",
      "The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. \n",
      "Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards.  There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start. \n",
      "Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. \n",
      "\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. \n",
      "\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we'll be able to see if it's true.\" \n",
      "\"Wish McGonagall favored us,\" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. \n",
      "Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. \n",
      "Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: \n",
      "Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an \n",
      "answer back with Hedwig. \n",
      "Hagrid \n",
      "Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. \n",
      "It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. \n",
      "At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry — he hated him. \n",
      "Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. \n",
      "Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name. \n",
      "\"Ah, yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.\" \n",
      "Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. \n",
      "\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had  the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\" \n",
      "More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead. \n",
      "\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\" \n",
      "Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air. \n",
      "\"I don't know, sir,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Snape's lips curled into a sneer. \n",
      "\"Tut, tut — fame clearly isn't everything.\" \n",
      "He ignored Hermione's hand. \n",
      "\"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\" \n",
      "Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. \n",
      "\"I don't know, sir.\" \"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" \n",
      "Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? \n",
      "Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand. \n",
      "\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfs-bane?\" \n",
      "At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. \n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?\" \n",
      "A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. \n",
      "\"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?\" \n",
      "There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\" \n",
      "Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. \n",
      "\"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\" \n",
      "Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. \n",
      "\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. \n",
      "\"You — Potter — why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.\" \n",
      "This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. \n",
      "\"Don't push it,\" he muttered, \"I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.\" \n",
      "As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\" \n",
      "At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. \n",
      "When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang — back.\" \n",
      "Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. \n",
      "\"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\" \n",
      "He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. \n",
      "There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \n",
      "\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. \n",
      "\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. \n",
      "\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. \"I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\" \n",
      "The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \"that old git'' \n",
      "\"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.\" \n",
      "Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. \n",
      "\"But he seemed to really hate me.\" \n",
      "\"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\" \n",
      "Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet \n",
      "his eyes when he said that. \"How's yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot — great with animals.\" \n",
      "Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: \n",
      "GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST \n",
      "Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. \n",
      "Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. \n",
      "\"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. \n",
      "Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date. \n",
      "\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!\" \n",
      "There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? \n",
      "As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n",
      "Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\" He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. \"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk.\" Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. \n",
      "Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. \n",
      "Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. \n",
      "Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl  was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. \n",
      "A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. \n",
      "\"It's a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things — this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh . . .\" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \". . . you've forgotten something . . .\" \n",
      "Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. \n",
      "Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. \n",
      "\"What's going on?\" \n",
      "\"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor.\" \n",
      "Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. \n",
      "\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. \n",
      "At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a  smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. \n",
      "The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. \n",
      "Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \n",
      "\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\" \n",
      "Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. \n",
      "\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say 'Up!' \" \n",
      "\"UP!\" everyone shouted. \n",
      "Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. \n",
      "Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years. \n",
      "\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few  feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle — three — two —\" \n",
      "But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips. \n",
      "\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and — \n",
      "WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. \n",
      "Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \n",
      "\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy — it's all right, up you get.\" \n",
      "She turned to the rest of the class. \n",
      "\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.\" \n",
      "Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. \n",
      "No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. \n",
      "\"Did you see his face, the great lump?\" \n",
      "The other Slytherins joined in. \n",
      "\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil. \"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\" \n",
      "\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \"It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.\" \n",
      "The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. \n",
      "\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. \n",
      "Malfoy smiled nastily. \n",
      "\"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?\" \n",
      "\"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\" \n",
      "Harry grabbed his broom. \n",
      "\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move — you'll get us all into trouble.\" \n",
      "Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. \n",
      "He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. \"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I'll knock you off that broom!\" \n",
      "\"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. \n",
      "Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping. \n",
      "\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called. \n",
      "The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. \n",
      "\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. \n",
      "Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he stretched out his hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. \n",
      "\"HARRY POTTER!\" \n",
      "His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. \n",
      "\"Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \"— how dare you — might have broken your neck —\" \n",
      "\"It wasn't his fault, Professor —\" \"Be quiet, Miss Patil —\" \n",
      "\"But Malfoy —\" \n",
      "\"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\" \n",
      "Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? \n",
      "Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside. \n",
      "\"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\" \n",
      "Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? \n",
      "But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick's class looking confused. \"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. \n",
      "\"In here.\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard. \n",
      "\"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. \n",
      "\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I've found you a Seeker.\" \n",
      "Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight. \n",
      "\"Are you serious, Professor?\" \n",
      "\"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy's a natural. I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\" \n",
      "Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. \n",
      "\"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it.\" \n",
      "Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. \n",
      "\"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly. \n",
      "\"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained. \n",
      "\"He's just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking  around Harry and staring at him. \"Light — speedy — we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.\" \n",
      "\"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. . . .\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. \n",
      "\"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\" \n",
      "Then she suddenly smiled. \n",
      "\"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\" \n",
      "\"You're joking.\" \n",
      "It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it. \n",
      "\"Seeker?\" he said. \"But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about —\" \n",
      "\"— a century,\" said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \"Wood told me.\" \n",
      "Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. \n",
      "\"I start training next week,\" said Harry. \"Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\" \n",
      "Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over. \"Well done,\" said George in a low voice. \"Wood told us. We're on the team too — Beaters.\" \n",
      "\"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,\" said Fred. \"We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\" \n",
      "\"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school.\" \n",
      "\"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\" \n",
      "Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. \n",
      "\"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\" \n",
      "\"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl. \n",
      "\"I'd take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy. \"Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only — no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?\" \n",
      "\"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around. \"I'm his second, who's yours?\" \n",
      "Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. \n",
      "\"Crabbe,\" he said. \"Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked.\" \n",
      "When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \"What is a wizard's duel?\" said Harry. \"And what do you mean, you're my second?\" \n",
      "\"Well, a second's there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\" \n",
      "\"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\" \n",
      "\"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested. \n",
      "\"Excuse me. \n",
      "They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. \n",
      "\"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?\" said Ron. \n",
      "Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. \n",
      "\"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —\" \n",
      "\"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered. \n",
      "\"— and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. It's really very selfish of you.\" \n",
      "\"And it's really none of your business,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Good-bye,\" said Ron. \n",
      "All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to  block them.\" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy's sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn't miss it. \n",
      "\"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we'd better go.\" \n",
      "They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry.\" \n",
      "A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. \n",
      "\"You!\" said Ron furiously. \"Go back to bed!\" \n",
      "\"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy — he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this.\" \n",
      "Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering. \n",
      "\"Come on,\" he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. \n",
      "Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. \n",
      "\"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\" \n",
      "\"Go away.\" \"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so —\" \n",
      "But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. \n",
      "\"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly. \n",
      "\"That's your problem,\" said Ron. \"We've got to go, we're going to be late.\" \n",
      "They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. \n",
      "\"I'm coming with you,\" she said. \n",
      "\"You are not.\" \n",
      "\"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\" \n",
      "\"You've got some nerve —\" said Ron loudly. \n",
      "\"Shut up, both of you!\" said Harry sharply. \"I heard something.\" \n",
      "It was a sort of snuffling. \n",
      "\"Mrs. Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. \n",
      "It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. \n",
      "\"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed.\" \n",
      "\"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere.\" \n",
      "\"How's your arm?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\" \"Good — well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later —\" \n",
      "\"Don't leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already.\" \n",
      "Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. \n",
      "\"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you. \n",
      "Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. \n",
      "They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. \n",
      "Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. \n",
      "\"He's late, maybe he's chickened out,\" Ron whispered. \n",
      "Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn't Malfoy. \n",
      "\"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\" \n",
      "It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. \n",
      "\"They're in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\" \n",
      "\"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor. \n",
      "The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle. \n",
      "\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room. \n",
      "\"I think we've lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. \n",
      "\"I — told — you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \"I — told — you.\" \n",
      "\"We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as possible.\" \"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don't you? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\" \n",
      "Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that. \n",
      "\"Let's go.\" \n",
      "It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. \n",
      "It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. \n",
      "\"Shut up, Peeves — please — you'll get us thrown out.\" \n",
      "Peeves cackled. \n",
      "\"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty.\" \n",
      "\"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please.\" \n",
      "\"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a sanity voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \"It's for your own good, you know.\" \n",
      "\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves — this was a big mistake. \n",
      "\"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\" \n",
      "Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked. \n",
      "\"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We're done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts. \n",
      "\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \"Alohomora!\" \n",
      "The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. \n",
      "\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\" \n",
      "\"Say 'please.' \" \n",
      "\"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\" \n",
      "\"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. \n",
      "\"All right — please.\" \n",
      "\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. \n",
      "\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we'll be okay — get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\" \n",
      "Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. \n",
      "They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. \n",
      "They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching  and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. \n",
      "It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. \n",
      "Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he'd take Filch. \n",
      "They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. \n",
      "\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. \n",
      "\"Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. \n",
      "It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again. \n",
      "\"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\" \n",
      "Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn't you see what it was standing on?\" \n",
      "\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\" \n",
      "\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something.\" \n",
      "She stood up, glaring at them. \n",
      "\"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\" \n",
      "Ron stared after her, his mouth open. \n",
      "\"No, we don't mind,\" he said. \"You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you?\" \n",
      "But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hog-warts. \n",
      "It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\n",
      "\n",
      "HALLOWEEN\n",
      "alfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \n",
      "\"It's either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Or both,\" said Harry. \n",
      "But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. \n",
      "Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. \n",
      "Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. \n",
      "As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. \n",
      "Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: \n",
      "DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. \n",
      "It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't \n",
      "want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll \n",
      "all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the \n",
      "Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training ses\n",
      "sion. \n",
      "Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. \"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I've never even touched one.\" \n",
      "They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. \n",
      "\"That's a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them.\" \n",
      "Ron couldn't resist it. \n",
      "\"It's not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus.\" \n",
      "\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\" \n",
      "Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow. \n",
      "\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked. \n",
      "\"Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly. \n",
      "\"Yes, yes, that's right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\" \n",
      "\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy's face. \"And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've got it,\" he added. \n",
      "Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it's true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouldn't be on the team. . . .\" \n",
      "\"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?\" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand. \n",
      "\"I thought you weren't speaking to us?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Yes, don't stop now,\" said Ron, \"it's doing us so much good.\" \n",
      "Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. \n",
      "Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. \n",
      "\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread. \n",
      "Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. \n",
      "As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He'd never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle  children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. \n",
      "Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. \n",
      "\"Hey, Potter, come down!\" \n",
      "Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him. \n",
      "\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall meant . . . you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.\" \n",
      "He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. \n",
      "\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\" \n",
      "\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \n",
      "\"This ball's called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\" \n",
      "\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" Harry recited. \"So — that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?\" \n",
      "\"What's basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly. \n",
      "\"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper — I'm Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\" \n",
      "\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. \n",
      "\"I'll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\" \n",
      "He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. \n",
      "\"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are the Bludgers.\" \n",
      "He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. \n",
      "\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. \n",
      "At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. \n",
      "\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you've got all that?\" \"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off. \n",
      "\"Very good,\" said Wood. \n",
      "\"Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. \n",
      "\"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —\" \n",
      "\"— unless they crack my head open.\" \n",
      "\"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\" \n",
      "Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. \n",
      "\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that's it — any questions?\" \n",
      "Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. \n",
      "\"We won't practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out with a few of these.\" \n",
      "He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. \n",
      "Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on. \n",
      "\"That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons.\" \n",
      "Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. \n",
      "On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's  partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived. \n",
      "\"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\" \n",
      "It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat. \n",
      "Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck. \n",
      "\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. \n",
      "\"You're saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.\" \n",
      "\"You do it, then, if you're so clever,\" Ron snarled. \n",
      "Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" \n",
      "Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. \n",
      "\"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!\" \n",
      "Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It's no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she's a nightmare, honestly.\" \n",
      "Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in tears. \n",
      "\"I think she heard you.\" \n",
      "\"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must've noticed she's got no friends.\" \n",
      "Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. \n",
      "A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. \n",
      "Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.\" \n",
      "He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. \n",
      "There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence. \"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\" \n",
      "Percy was in his element. \n",
      "\"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!\" \n",
      "\"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. \n",
      "\"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\" \n",
      "They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm. \n",
      "\"I've just thought — Hermione.\" \n",
      "\"What about her?\" \n",
      "\"She doesn't know about the troll.\" \n",
      "Ron bit his lip. \n",
      "\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy'd better not see us.\" \n",
      "Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. \n",
      "\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. \n",
      "Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. \n",
      "\"What's he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\" \n",
      "\"Search me.\" Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps. \n",
      "\"He's heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. \n",
      "\"Can you smell something?\" \n",
      "Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. \n",
      "And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. \n",
      "It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. \n",
      "The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. \n",
      "\"The key's in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\" \n",
      "\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously. \n",
      "They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. \n",
      "\"Yes!\" \n",
      "Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up. \n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. \n",
      "\"It's the girls' bathroom!\" Harry gasped. \n",
      "\"Hermione!\" they said together. \n",
      "It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. \n",
      "Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. \n",
      "\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. \n",
      "The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. \n",
      "\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. \n",
      "\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. \n",
      "The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll  berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. \n",
      "Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils. \n",
      "Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. \n",
      "Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" \n",
      "The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. \n",
      "Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. \n",
      "It was Hermione who spoke first. \n",
      "\"Is it — dead?\" \n",
      "\"I don't think so,\" said Harry, \"I think it's just been knocked out.\" \n",
      "He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. \"Urgh — troll boogers.\" \n",
      "He wiped it on the troll's trousers. \n",
      "A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. \n",
      "Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind. \n",
      "\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \"You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory?\" \n",
      "Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. \n",
      "Then a small voice came out of the shadows. \n",
      "\"Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.\" \n",
      "\"Miss Granger!\" \n",
      "Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. \n",
      "\"I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know, because I've read all about them.\" \n",
      "Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? \"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\" \n",
      "Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them. \n",
      "\"Well — in that case . . .\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\" \n",
      "Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. \n",
      "\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are finishing the feast in their Houses.\" \n",
      "Hermione left. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. \n",
      "\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\" \n",
      "They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. \n",
      "\"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled. \n",
      "\"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.\" \"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind you, we did save her.\" \n",
      "\"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her,\" Harry reminded him. \n",
      "They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \n",
      "\"Pig snout,\" they said and entered. \n",
      "The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates. \n",
      "But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "QUIDDITCH\n",
      "As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House Championship. Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse — people telling him he'd be  brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress. \n",
      "It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. \n",
      "Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. \n",
      "Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. \n",
      "\"What's that you've got there, Potter?\" \n",
      "It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. \"Library books are not to be taken outside the school,\" said Snape. \"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\" \n",
      "\"He's just made that rule up,\" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. \"Wonder what's wrong with his leg?\" \n",
      "\"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,\" said Ron bitterly. \n",
      "The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How will you learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. \n",
      "Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. \n",
      "\"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening. \n",
      "He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. \n",
      "Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside — and a horrible scene met his eyes. \n",
      "Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages. \n",
      "\"Blasted thing,\" Snape was saying. \"How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\" \n",
      "Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — \"POTTER!\" \n",
      "Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. \n",
      "\"I just wondered if I could have my book back.\" \n",
      "\"GET OUT! OUT !\" \n",
      "Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. \n",
      "\"Did you get it?\" Ron asked as Harry joined them. \"What's the matter?\" \n",
      "In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen. \n",
      "\"You know what this means?\" he finished breathlessly. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when we saw him — he's after whatever it's guarding! And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\" \n",
      "Hermione's eyes were wide. \n",
      "\"No — he wouldn't,\" she said. \"I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\" \n",
      "\"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\" snapped Ron. \"I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But what's he after? What's that dog guarding?\" \n",
      "Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget. \n",
      "The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer- ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch \n",
      "match. \n",
      "\"You've got to eat some breakfast.\" \n",
      "\"I don't want anything.\" \n",
      "\"Just a bit of toast,\" wheedled Hermione. \n",
      "\"I'm not hungry.\" \n",
      "Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field. \n",
      "\"Harry, you need your strength,\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\" \n",
      "\"Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. \n",
      "By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. \n",
      "Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors. \n",
      "Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green). \n",
      "Wood cleared his throat for silence. \"Okay, men,\" he said. \n",
      "\"And women,\" said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \n",
      "\"And women,\" Wood agreed. \"This is it.\" \n",
      "\"The big one,\" said Fred Weasley. \n",
      "\"The one we've all been waiting for,\" said George. \n",
      "\"We know Oliver's speech by heart,\" Fred told Harry, \"we were on the team last year.\" \n",
      "\"Shut up, you two,\" said Wood. \"This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years. We're going to win. I know it.\" \n",
      "He glared at them all as if to say, \"Or else.\" \n",
      "\"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you.\" \n",
      "Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. \n",
      "Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. \n",
      "\"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\" she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. \n",
      "\"Mount your brooms, please.\" \n",
      "Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. \n",
      "Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. \n",
      "Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. \n",
      "\"And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather at\n",
      "tractive, too —\" \n",
      "\"JORDAN!\" \n",
      "\"Sorry, Professor.\" \n",
      "The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. \n",
      "\"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she's really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\" \n",
      "Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. \n",
      "\"Budge up there, move along.\" \n",
      "\"Hagrid!\" \n",
      "Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them. \"Bin watchin' from me hut,\" said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \"But it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\" \n",
      "\"Nope,\" said Ron. \"Harry hasn't had much to do yet.\" \n",
      "\"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin',\" said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry. \n",
      "Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan. \n",
      "\"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had said. \"We don't want you attacked before you have to be.\" \n",
      "When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it. \n",
      "\"All right there, Harry?\" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. \n",
      "\"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch?\" \n",
      "A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear. \n",
      "Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch. \n",
      "Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of speed — \n",
      "WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. \n",
      "\"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors. \n",
      "Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. \n",
      "Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref! Red card!\" \n",
      "\"What are you talking about, Dean?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Red card!\" said Dean furiously. \"In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!\" \n",
      "\"But this isn't soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him. \n",
      "Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side. \n",
      "\"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\" \n",
      "Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \n",
      "\"So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —\" \n",
      "\"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall. \n",
      "\"I mean, after that open and revolting foul —\" \n",
      "\"Jordan, I'm warning you —\" \n",
      "\"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor,  taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\" \n",
      "It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt anything like that. \n",
      "It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. \n",
      "Lee was still commentating. \n",
      "\"Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no . . .\" \n",
      "The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went. \n",
      "\"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing,\" Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \"If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of his broom . . . but he can't have. . . .\" \n",
      "Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands.  His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand. \n",
      "\"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\" Seamus whispered. \n",
      "\"Can't have,\" Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \"Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\" \n",
      "At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd. \n",
      "\"What are you doing?\" moaned Ron, gray-faced. \n",
      "\"I knew it,\" Hermione gasped, \"Snape — look.\" \n",
      "Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. \n",
      "\"He's doing something — jinxing the broom,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"What should we do?\" \n",
      "\"Leave it to me.\" \n",
      "Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good — every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus  Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone \n",
      "noticing. \n",
      "\"Come on, Hermione,\" Ron muttered desperately. \n",
      "Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes. \n",
      "It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know what had happened. \n",
      "It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. \n",
      "\"Neville, you can look!\" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes. \n",
      "Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand. \n",
      "\"I've got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion. \n",
      "\"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being  made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione. \n",
      "\"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.\" \n",
      "\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do some-thin' like that?\" \n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. \n",
      "\"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding.\" \n",
      "Hagrid dropped the teapot. \n",
      "\"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said. \n",
      "\"Fluffy?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah — he's mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the —\" \n",
      "\"Yes?\" said Harry eagerly. \n",
      "\"Now, don't ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That's top secret, that is.\" \n",
      "\"But Snape's trying to steal it.\" \n",
      "\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid again. \"Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort.\" \n",
      "\"So why did he just try and kill Harry?\" cried Hermione. \n",
      "The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. \n",
      "\"I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!  You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!\" \n",
      "\"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!\" said Hagrid hotly. \"I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel —\" \n",
      "\"Aha!\" said Harry, \"so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\" \n",
      "Hagrid looked furious with himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE MIRROR OF ERISED\n",
      "Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. \"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home.\" \n",
      "He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. \n",
      "It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. \n",
      "When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it. \n",
      "\"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches. \n",
      "\"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron.\" \n",
      "\"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoy's cold drawl from behind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to.\" \n",
      "Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \n",
      "\"WEASLEY!\" \n",
      "Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes. \n",
      "\"He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \"Malfoy was insultin' his family.\" \n",
      "\"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said Snape silkily. \"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you.\" \n",
      "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \n",
      "\"I'll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, \"one of these days, I'll get him —\" \n",
      "\"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\" \n",
      "\"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,\" said Hagrid. \"Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\" \n",
      "So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. \n",
      "\"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?\" \n",
      "The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. \n",
      "\"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked. \"Just one,\" said Hermione. \"And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\" \n",
      "\"Oh yeah, you're right,\" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. \n",
      "\"The library?\" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \"Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, we're not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is.\" \n",
      "\"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here — I've told yeh — drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'.\" \n",
      "\"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I've read his name somewhere.\" \n",
      "\"I'm sayin' nothin',\" said Hagrid flatly. \n",
      "\"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. \n",
      "They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. \n",
      "Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \n",
      "\"What are you looking for, boy?\" \n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. \n",
      "\"You'd better get out, then. Go on — out!\" \n",
      "Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to. \n",
      "Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. \n",
      "\"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?\" said Hermione. \"And send me an owl if you find anything.\" \n",
      "\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron. \"It'd be safe to ask them.\" \n",
      "\"Very safe, as they're both dentists,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work. \n",
      "Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. \n",
      "Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. \n",
      "\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. \n",
      "\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I've got some presents!\" \n",
      "\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's. \n",
      "Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl. \n",
      "A second, very small parcel contained a note. \n",
      "We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece. \n",
      "\"That's friendly,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \n",
      "\"Weird!\" he said, \"What a shape! This is money?\" \n",
      "\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?\" \n",
      "\"I think I know who that one's from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn't expect any presents and — oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she's made you a Weasley sweater.\" \n",
      "Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. \"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and mine's always maroon.\" \n",
      "\"That's really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty. \n",
      "His next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. \n",
      "This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. \n",
      "Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. \n",
      "\"I've heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. \"If that's what I think it is — they're really rare, and really valuable.\" \n",
      "\"What is it?\" \n",
      "Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. \n",
      "\"It's an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I'm sure it is — try it on.\" \n",
      "Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell. \n",
      "\"It is! Look down!\" \n",
      "Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. \n",
      "\"There's a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\" \n",
      "Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before \n",
      "he died. It is time it was returned to you. \n",
      "Use it well. \n",
      "A Very Merry Christmas to you. \n",
      "There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak. \n",
      "\"I'd give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What's the matter?\" \n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? \n",
      "Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. \n",
      "\"Merry Christmas!\" \n",
      "\"Hey, look — Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\" \n",
      "Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. \n",
      "\"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.\" \n",
      "\"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.\" \n",
      "\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. \n",
      "\"You haven't got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid — we know we're called Gred and Forge.\" \"What's all this noise?\" \n",
      "Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. \n",
      "\"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\" \n",
      "\"I — don't — want —\" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. \n",
      "\"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George. \"Christmas is a time for family.\" \n",
      "They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater. \n",
      "Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. \n",
      "Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. \n",
      "When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner. \n",
      "Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much. \n",
      "After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge. \n",
      "It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it. \n",
      "Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. His father's . . . this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said. \n",
      "He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. \n",
      "Use it well. \n",
      "Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. \n",
      "Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back — his father's cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use it alone. \n",
      "He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. \n",
      "\"Who's there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. \n",
      "Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked. \n",
      "The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. \n",
      "The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. \n",
      "They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be. \n",
      "He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. \n",
      "A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears. \n",
      "He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library — Restricted Section.\" \n",
      "Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.\" \n",
      "Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him — the cloak didn't stop him from being solid. \n",
      "He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. \n",
      "It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. \n",
      "It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. \n",
      "He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. \n",
      "But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. \n",
      "There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? \n",
      "He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air — she and the others existed only in the mirror. \n",
      "She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did. \n",
      "Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. \"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\" \n",
      "They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. \n",
      "The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. \n",
      "How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, \"I'll come back,\" and hurried from the room. \n",
      "\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly. \n",
      "\"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.\" \n",
      "\"I'd like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly. \n",
      "\"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\" \n",
      "\"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?\" \n",
      "Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the threeheaded dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \n",
      "\"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\" \n",
      "What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. \n",
      "\"I'm freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let's forget it and go back.\" \n",
      "\"No!\" Harry hissed. \"I know it's here somewhere.\" \n",
      "They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. \n",
      "\"It's here — just here — yes!\" \n",
      "They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. \n",
      "There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. \n",
      "\"See?\" Harry whispered. \n",
      "\"I can't see anything.\" \n",
      "\"Look! Look at them all . . . there are loads of them. . . .\" \n",
      "\"I can only see you.\" \n",
      "\"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\" \n",
      "Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. \n",
      "Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \n",
      "\"Look at me!\" he said. \n",
      "\"Can you see all your family standing around you?\" \"No — I'm alone — but I'm different — I look older — and I'm Head Boy!\" \n",
      "\"What?\" \n",
      "\"I am — I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I'm holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I'm Quidditch captain, too!\" \n",
      "Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. \n",
      "\"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\" \n",
      "\"How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —\" \n",
      "\"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\" \n",
      "\"You're only holding the Quidditch Cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\" \n",
      "\"Don't push me —\" \n",
      "A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking. \n",
      "\"Quick!\" \n",
      "Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left. \n",
      "\"This isn't safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\" \n",
      "And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. \n",
      "The snow still hadn't melted the next morning. \n",
      "\"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"No.\" \"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?\" \n",
      "\"No . . . you go . . .\" \n",
      "\"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight.\" \n",
      "\"Why not?\" \n",
      "\"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\" \n",
      "\"You sound like Hermione.\" \n",
      "\"I'm serious, Harry, don't go.\" \n",
      "But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him. \n",
      "That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone. \n",
      "And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. \n",
      "Except — \n",
      "\"So — back again, Harry?\" \n",
      "Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him. \n",
      "\"I — I didn't see you, sir.\" \"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. \n",
      "\"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\" \n",
      "\"I didn't know it was called that, sir.\" \n",
      "\"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?\" \n",
      "\"It — well — it shows me my family —\" \n",
      "\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.\" \n",
      "\"How did you know — ?\" \n",
      "\"I don't need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\" \n",
      "Harry shook his head. \n",
      "\"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\" \n",
      "Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want . . . whatever we want . . .\" \n",
      "\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. \n",
      "\"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry,  and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\" \n",
      "Harry stood up. \n",
      "\"Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\" \n",
      "\"Obviously, you've just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one more thing, however.\" \n",
      "\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \n",
      "\"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" \n",
      "Harry stared. \n",
      "\"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\" \n",
      "It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\n",
      "\n",
      "NICHOLAS FLAMEL\n",
      "Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. \"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again. \n",
      "Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training. \n",
      "Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. \n",
      "\"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\" \n",
      "George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. \n",
      "\"Snape's refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\" \n",
      "The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. \n",
      "\"It's not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us.\" Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quid-ditch. . . . \n",
      "The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. \n",
      "\"Don't talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \"I need to concen-\" He caught sight of Harry's face. \"What's the matter with you? You look terrible.\" \n",
      "Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. \n",
      "\"Don't play,\" said Hermione at once. \n",
      "\"Say you're ill,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested. \n",
      "\"Really break your leg,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"I can't,\" said Harry. \"There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can't play at all.\" \n",
      "At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. \n",
      "Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron. \n",
      "\"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on.\" \n",
      "\"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report him!\" \n",
      "Neville shook his head. \n",
      "\"I don't want more trouble,\" he mumbled. \n",
      "\"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\" \n",
      "\"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that,\" Neville choked out. \n",
      "Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry. \n",
      "\"You're worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\" \n",
      "Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. \n",
      "\"Thanks, Harry . . . I think I'll go to bed. . . . D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?\" \n",
      "As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card. \n",
      "\"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever —\" \n",
      "He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione. \"I've found him!\" he whispered. \"I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!\" \n",
      "Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework. \n",
      "\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. \n",
      "\"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\" \n",
      "\"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. \n",
      "At last she found what she was looking for. \n",
      "\"I knew it! I knew it!\" \n",
      "\"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him. \n",
      "\"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!\" \n",
      "This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected. \n",
      "\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron. \n",
      "\"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look — read that, there.\" \n",
      "She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. \n",
      "There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). \n",
      "\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\" \n",
      "\"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry. \"No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it.\" \n",
      "\"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?\" \n",
      "The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. \"I'm going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show them . . . it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\" \n",
      "\"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? \n",
      "Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds. \n",
      "Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand. \n",
      "Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. \n",
      "\"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. \n",
      "\"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don't nag.\" \n",
      "Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside. \n",
      "\"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\" \n",
      "\"The whole school's out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \"Even — blimey — Dumbledore's come to watch!\" \n",
      "Harry's heart did a somersault. \n",
      "\"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. \n",
      "Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. \n",
      "Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too. \n",
      "\"I've never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione. \"Look — they're off. Ouch!\" \n",
      "Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy. \n",
      "\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there.\" \n",
      "Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. \n",
      "\"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\" Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch. \n",
      "\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money — you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains.\" \n",
      "Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy. \n",
      "\"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered. \n",
      "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville.\" \n",
      "\"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something.\" \n",
      "Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry. \n",
      "\"I'm warning you, Malfoy — one more word —\" \n",
      "\"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry — !\" \n",
      "\"What? Where?\" \n",
      "Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \n",
      "\"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said Malfoy. Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. \n",
      "\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. \n",
      "Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand. \n",
      "The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly. \n",
      "\"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. \n",
      "Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it — the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face. \n",
      "\"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . excellent . . .\" \n",
      "Snape spat bitterly on the ground.&bull; Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now — no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. \n",
      "Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape. . . . \n",
      "And speaking of Snape . . . \n",
      "A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner — what was going on? \n",
      "Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. \n",
      "The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree. \n",
      "He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying. \n",
      "\". . . d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus . . .\" \n",
      "\"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy. \"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all.\" \n",
      "Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him. \n",
      "\"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?\" \n",
      "\"B-b-but Severus, I —\" \n",
      "\"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step toward him. \n",
      "\"I-I don't know what you —\" \n",
      "\"You know perfectly well what I mean.\" \n",
      "An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \"— your little bit of hocus-pocus. I'm waiting.\" \n",
      "\"B-but I d-d-don't —\" \n",
      "\"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\" \n",
      "He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified. \"Harry, where have you been?\" Hermione squeaked. \n",
      "\"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he'll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\" \n",
      "\"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this. . . .\" \n",
      "He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard. \n",
      "\"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocuspocus' — I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through —\" \n",
      "\"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\" said Hermione in alarm. \n",
      "\"It'll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\n",
      "Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet. \n",
      "Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter. \n",
      "Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. \n",
      "\"Hermione, the exams are ages away.\" \n",
      "\"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\" \n",
      "\"But we're not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \"Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it all.\" \n",
      "\"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me. \n",
      "Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. \n",
      "\"I'll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming. \n",
      "Harry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?\" \n",
      "Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. \n",
      "\"Jus' lookin',\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \"An' what're you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \"Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \"And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St —\" \n",
      "\"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?\" \n",
      "\"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said Harry, \"about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —\" \n",
      "\"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \"Listen — come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh —\" \n",
      "\"See you later, then,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Hagrid shuffled off. \n",
      "\"What was he hiding behind his back?\" said Hermione thoughtfully. \n",
      "\"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\" \n",
      "\"I'm going to see what section he was in,\" said Ron, who'd had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. \n",
      "\"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide.\" \n",
      "\"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"But it's against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden — anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dan- \n",
      "gerous. You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Ro\n",
      "mania.\" \n",
      "\"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Of course there are,\" said Ron. \"Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget.\" \n",
      "\"So what on earth's Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione. \n",
      "When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them. \n",
      "It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused. \n",
      "\"So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \"We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from Fluffy.\" \n",
      "Hagrid frowned at him. \n",
      "\"O' course I can't,\" he said. \"Number one, I don' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\" said  Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \"We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\" Hermione went on. \"We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\" \n",
      "Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione. \n",
      "\"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that . . . let's see . . . he borrowed Fluffy from me . . . then some o' the teachers did enchantments . . . Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —\" he ticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell — an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\" \n",
      "\"Snape?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah — yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it.\" \n",
      "Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy. \n",
      "\"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren't you, Hagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\" \n",
      "\"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly. \n",
      "\"Well, that's something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Ha-grid, can we have a window open? I'm boiling.\" \n",
      "\"Can't, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. \n",
      "\"Hagrid — what's that?\" \n",
      "But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That's — er . . .\" \n",
      "\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \"It must've cost you a fortune.\" \n",
      "\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\" \n",
      "\"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"Well, I've bin doin' some readin',\" said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on 'em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An' see here — how ter recognize diff'rent eggs — what I got there's a Norwegian Ridge-back. They're rare, them.\" \n",
      "He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't. \n",
      "\"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said. \n",
      "But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire. \n",
      "So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. \n",
      "Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It's hatching. \n",
      "Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn't hear of it. \n",
      "\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\" \n",
      "\"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing —\" \n",
      "\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered. \n",
      "Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all. \n",
      "Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited. \n",
      "\"It's nearly out.\" He ushered them inside. \n",
      "The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it. \n",
      "They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath. \n",
      "All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. \n",
      "It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \n",
      "\"Isn't he beautiful?\" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs. \n",
      "\"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\" \n",
      "Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. \n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" \n",
      "\"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains — it's a kid — he's runnin' back up ter the school.\" \n",
      "Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him. \n",
      "Malfoy had seen the dragon. \n",
      "Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him. \n",
      "\"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\" \n",
      "\"I can't,\" said Hagrid. \"He's too little. He'd die.\" They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor. \n",
      "\"I've decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mommy?\" \n",
      "\"He's lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry's ear. \n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\" \n",
      "Hagrid bit his lip. \n",
      "\"I — I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, can't.\" \n",
      "Harry suddenly turned to Ron. \n",
      "\"Charlie,\" he said. \n",
      "\"You're losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I'm Ron, remember?\" \n",
      "\"No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\" \n",
      "\"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\" \n",
      "And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him. \n",
      "The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just  \n",
      "chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. \n",
      "\"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \"I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\" \n",
      "There was a tap on the dark window. \"It's Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She'll have Charlie's answer!\" The three of them put their heads together to read the note. \n",
      "Dear Ron, \n",
      "How are you? Thanks for the letter — I'd be glad to take \n",
      "the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him \n",
      "here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with \n",
      "some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. \n",
      "Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon. \n",
      "Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark. \n",
      "Send me an answer as soon as possible. \n",
      "Love, \n",
      "Charlie They looked at one another. \n",
      "\"We've got the Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn't be too difficult — I think the cloak's big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\" \n",
      "It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy. \n",
      "There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey — would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous. \n",
      "Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed. \n",
      "\"It's not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it's about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me — I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this.\" \n",
      "Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. \n",
      "\"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. \n",
      "\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no — oh no — I've just remembered — Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.\" \n",
      "Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. \n",
      "\"It's too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.\" \n",
      "They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them. \n",
      "\"I won't let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert's at a tricky stage — nothin' I can't handle.\" \n",
      "When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. \n",
      "\"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot — jus' playin' — he's only a baby, after all.\" \n",
      "The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough. \n",
      "They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \n",
      "\"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Ha-grid in a muffled voice. \"An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\" \n",
      "From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off. \n",
      "\"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \"Mommy will never forget you!\" \n",
      "How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another — even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier. \n",
      "\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower. \n",
      "Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear. \n",
      "\"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you —\" \n",
      "\"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming — he's got a dragon!\" \n",
      "\"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\" \n",
      "The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \n",
      "\"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!\" \n",
      "\"Don't,\" Harry advised her. \n",
      "Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. \n",
      "Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much. \n",
      "At last, Norbert was going . . . going . . . gone. \n",
      "They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — what could spoil their happiness? \n",
      "The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness. \n",
      "\"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\" \n",
      "They'd left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE FORBIDDEN FOREST\n",
      "Things couldn't have been worse. Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already. Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville. \"Harry!\" Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag —\" \n",
      "Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them. \n",
      "\"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\" \n",
      "It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. \n",
      "\"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\" \n",
      "Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them. \n",
      "\"I'm disgusted,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Four students out of bed in one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\" \"Fifty?\" Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last Quidditch match. \n",
      "\"Fifty points each,\" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. \n",
      "\"Professor — please —\" \n",
      "\"You can't —\" \n",
      "\"Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\" \n",
      "A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? \n",
      "Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done? \n",
      "At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the House points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years. \n",
      "From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \"Thanks Potter, we owe you one!\" \n",
      "Only Ron stood by him. \n",
      "\"They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them.\" \n",
      "\"They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\" said Harry miserably. \n",
      "\"Well — no,\" Ron admitted. \n",
      "It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team. \n",
      "\"Resign?\" Wood thundered. \"What good'll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?\" \n",
      "But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \"the Seeker.\" \n",
      "Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence. \n",
      "Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. . . . \n",
      "Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice. \n",
      "\"No — no — not again, please —\" \n",
      "It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer. \n",
      "\"All right — all right —\" he heard Quirrell sob. \n",
      "Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling. \n",
      "All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last. \n",
      "Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard. \n",
      "\"Snape's done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —\" \n",
      "\"There's still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\" said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\" \n",
      "The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. \n",
      "\"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure.\" \n",
      "\"But we've got no proof !\" said Harry. \"Quirrell's too scared to back us up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot of explaining.\" \n",
      "Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't. \n",
      "\"If we just do a bit of poking around —\" \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we've done enough poking around.\" \n",
      "He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons. \n",
      "The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: \n",
      "Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got. \n",
      "At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too. \n",
      "\"Follow me,\" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside. \n",
      "\"I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh?\" he said, leering at them. \"Oh yes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me. . . . It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed. . . . Right, off we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do.\" \n",
      "They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted. \n",
      "The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut. Then they heard a distant shout. \n",
      "\"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\" \n",
      "Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn't be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, \"I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself  with that oaf? Well, think again, boy — it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece.\" \n",
      "At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. \n",
      "\"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual. \"We can't go in there at night — there's all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard.\" \n",
      "Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise. \n",
      "\"That's your problem, isn't it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \"Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?\" \n",
      "Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. \n",
      "\"Abou' time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\" \n",
      "\"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\" said Filch coldly, \"they're here to be punished, after all.\" \n",
      "\"That's why yer late, is it?\" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \"Bin lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit, I'll take over from here.\" \n",
      "\"I'll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what's left of them,\" he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness. \n",
      "Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. \n",
      "\"I'm not going in that forest,\" he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. \"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\" said Hagrid fiercely. \"Yeh've done wrong an' now yeh've got ter pay fer it.\" \n",
      "\"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd —\" \n",
      "\"— tell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts,\" Hagrid growled. \"Copyin' lines! What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or yeh'll get out. If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack. Go on!\" \n",
      "Malfoy didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze. \n",
      "\"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow me over here a moment.\" \n",
      "He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest. \n",
      "\"Look there,\" said Hagrid, \"see that stuff shinin' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\" \n",
      "\"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\" said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. \n",
      "\"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\" said Hagrid. \"An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff 'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' \n",
      "around since last night at least.\" \n",
      "\"I want Fang,\" said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth. \n",
      "\"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,\" said Hagrid. \"So me, Harry, an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practice now — that's it — an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh — so, be careful — let's go.\" \n",
      "The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. \n",
      "They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves. \n",
      "Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. \n",
      "\"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked. \n",
      "\"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\" \n",
      "They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path. \n",
      "\"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\" \n",
      "Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it  into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away. \n",
      "\"I knew it,\" he murmured. \"There's summat in here that shouldn' be.\" \n",
      "\"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested. \n",
      "\"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,\" said Hagrid grimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\" \n",
      "They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. \n",
      "\"Who's there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself — I'm armed!\" \n",
      "And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped. \n",
      "\"Oh, it's you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\" \n",
      "He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand. \n",
      "\"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\" \n",
      "\"Can't be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \"There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an' Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is Ronan, you two. He's a centaur.\" \n",
      "\"We'd noticed,\" said Hermione faintly. \n",
      "\"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\" \"Erm —\" \n",
      "\"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly. \n",
      "\"A bit. Well, that's something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\" \n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin'?\" \n",
      "Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. \n",
      "\"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said. \"So it has been for ages past, so it is now.\" \n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan? Any-thin' unusual?\" \n",
      "\"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \"Unusually bright.\" \n",
      "\"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home,\" said Hagrid. \"So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?\" \n",
      "Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \"The forest hides many secrets.\" \n",
      "A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan. \n",
      "\"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\" \n",
      "\"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\" \n",
      "\"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen any-thin' odd in here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin' about it?\" \n",
      "Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \"Mars is bright tonight,\" he said simply. \n",
      "\"We've heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. \"Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then.\" \n",
      "Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view. \n",
      "\"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the moon.\" \n",
      "\"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione. \n",
      "\"Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind, centaurs . . . they know things . . . jus' don' let on much.\" \n",
      "\"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicorns — never heard anythin' like it before.\" \n",
      "They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm. \n",
      "\"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\" \n",
      "\"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay on the path, I'll come back for yeh!\" \n",
      "They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them. \"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione. \n",
      "\"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville . . . it's our fault he's here in the first place.\" \n",
      "The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? \n",
      "At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. \n",
      "\"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'. Right, we're changin' groups — Neville, you stay with me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry,\" Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \"but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this done.\" \n",
      "So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak. \n",
      "\"Look —\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. \n",
      "Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. \n",
      "It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. \n",
      "Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. . . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animals side, and began to drink its blood. \n",
      "\"AAAAAAAAAAARGH!\" \n",
      "Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn't move for fear. \n",
      "Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. \n",
      "The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. \n",
      "\"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. \n",
      "\"Yes — thank you — what was that?\" \n",
      "The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead. \"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. \n",
      "\"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. \n",
      "There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. \n",
      "\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\" \n",
      "\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\" \n",
      "\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\" \n",
      "Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\" he said in his gloomy voice. \n",
      "Bane kicked his back legs in anger. \n",
      "\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\" \n",
      "Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. \n",
      "\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\" \n",
      "And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane be\n",
      "hind them. \n",
      "Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. \n",
      "\"Why's Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\" \n",
      "Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\" \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\" \n",
      "\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\" \n",
      "Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight. \n",
      "\"But who'd be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you're going to be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?\" \n",
      "\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength and power — something that will mean you  can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\" \n",
      "\"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don't understand who —\" \n",
      "\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\" \n",
      "It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\" \n",
      "\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol —\" \n",
      "\"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\" \n",
      "Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her. \n",
      "\"I'm fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The unicorns dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.\" \n",
      "\"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\" \n",
      "Harry slid off his back. \n",
      "\"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\" \n",
      "He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. \n",
      "Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest. \n",
      "Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking. \n",
      "\"Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort . . . and Voldemort's waiting in the forest . . . and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. \n",
      "Harry wasn't listening. \n",
      "\"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so. . . . Bane was furious . . . he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen. . . . They must show that Voldemort's coming back. . . . Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. . . . I suppose that's written in the stars as well.\" \n",
      "\"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed. \n",
      "\"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry went on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off. . . . Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy.\" \n",
      "Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort. \n",
      "\"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic.\" \n",
      "The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went  to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over. \n",
      "When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it: \n",
      "Just in case.\n",
      "\n",
      "THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n",
      "In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. \n",
      "Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. \n",
      "Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented self-stirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest. \n",
      "\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\" \n",
      "Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.\" \n",
      "Harry was rubbing his forehead. \n",
      "\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting — it's happened before, but never as often as this.\" \n",
      "\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested. \n",
      "\"I'm not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it's a warning . . . it means danger's coming. . . .\" \n",
      "Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot. \n",
      "\"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quid-ditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\" \n",
      "Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.\" \n",
      "Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Ha-grid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy . . . never . . . but — \n",
      "Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. \"Where're you going?\" said Ron sleepily. \n",
      "\"I've just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white. \"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.\" \n",
      "\"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \n",
      "\"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?\" \n",
      "\"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer. \n",
      "Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. \n",
      "\"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\" \n",
      "\"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off. \n",
      "\"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\" \n",
      "\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\" \n",
      "He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. \n",
      "\"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head — that's one o' the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\" \n",
      "Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\" \n",
      "\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \"Yeah . . . he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here. . . . He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after . . . so I told him . . . an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon . . . an' then . . . I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks. . . . Let's see . . . yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home. . . . So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. . . .\" \n",
      "\"And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. \n",
      "\"Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep —\" \n",
      "Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. \n",
      "\"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey — where're yeh goin'?\" \n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. \n",
      "\"We've got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must've been easy, once he'd got Ha-grid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him. Where's Dumbledore's office?\" They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. \n",
      "\"We'll just have to —\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. \n",
      "\"What are you three doing inside?\" \n",
      "It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. \n",
      "\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. \n",
      "\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\" \n",
      "Harry swallowed — now what? \n",
      "\"It's sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared. \n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\" \n",
      "\"He's gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\" \n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time —\" \n",
      "\"But this is important.\" \n",
      "\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\" \n",
      "\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor — it's about the Sorcerer's Stone —\" \n",
      "Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up. \"How do you know — ?\" she spluttered. \n",
      "\"Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone's going to try and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\" \n",
      "She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. \"I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected.\" \n",
      "\"But Professor —\" \n",
      "\"Potter, I know what I'm talking about,\" she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. \"I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\" \n",
      "But they didn't. \n",
      "\"It's tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \"Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\" \n",
      "\"But what can we —\" \n",
      "Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. \n",
      "Snape was standing there. \n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly. \n",
      "They stared at him. \n",
      "\"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile. \n",
      "\"We were —\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. \n",
      "\"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around  like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?\" \n",
      "Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. \n",
      "\"Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\" \n",
      "He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. \n",
      "Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \n",
      "\"Right, here's what we've got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that.\" \n",
      "\"Why me?\" \n",
      "\"It's obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \" 'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . .'\" \n",
      "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. \n",
      "\"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron. \"Come on.\" \n",
      "But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. \n",
      "\"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own House!\" Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione's on Snape's tail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. \n",
      "\"I'm sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went.\" \n",
      "\"Well, that's it then, isn't it?\" Harry said. \n",
      "The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. \n",
      "\"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first.\" \n",
      "\"You're mad!\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"You can't!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You'll be expelled!\" \n",
      "\"SO WHAT?\" Harry shouted. \"Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\" \n",
      "He glared at them. \"You're right, Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \n",
      "\"I'll use the Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lucky I got it back.\" \n",
      "\"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"All — all three of us?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?\" \n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go and look through my books, there might be something useful. . . .\" \n",
      "\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\" \n",
      "\"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not throwing me out after that.\" \n",
      "After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. \n",
      "Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \n",
      "\"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Ha-grid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn't feel much like singing. \n",
      "He ran back down to the common room. \"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —\" \n",
      "\"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom. \n",
      "\"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. \n",
      "Neville stared at their guilty faces. \n",
      "\"You're going out again,\" he said. \n",
      "\"No, no, no,\" said Hermione. \"No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?\" \n",
      "Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. \n",
      "\"You can't go out,\" said Neville, \"you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\" \n",
      "\"You don't understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\" \n",
      "But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. \n",
      "\"I won't let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \"I'll — I'll fight you!\" \n",
      "\"Neville,\" Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don't be an idiot —\" \n",
      "\"Don't you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. \"I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\" \"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don't know what you're doing.\" \n",
      "He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. \n",
      "\"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I'm ready!\" \n",
      "Harry turned to Hermione. \n",
      "\"Do something,\" he said desperately. \n",
      "Hermione stepped forward. \n",
      "\"Neville,\" she said, \"I'm really, really sorry about this.\" \n",
      "She raised her wand. \n",
      "\"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville. \n",
      "Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. \n",
      "Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. \n",
      "\"What've you done to him?\" Harry whispered. \n",
      "\"It's the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry.\" \n",
      "\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"You'll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. \n",
      "But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. \n",
      "\"Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything. \n",
      "They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. \n",
      "\"Who's there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \"Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\" \n",
      "He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. \n",
      "\"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.\" \n",
      "Harry had a sudden idea. \n",
      "\"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\" \n",
      "Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. \n",
      "\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,\" he said greasily. \"My mistake, my mistake — I didn't see you — of course I didn't, you're invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\" \n",
      "\"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this place tonight.\" \n",
      "\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.\" \n",
      "And he scooted off. \"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron. \n",
      "A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar. \n",
      "\"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape's already got past Fluffy.\" \n",
      "Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. \n",
      "\"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the cloak, I won't need it now.\" \n",
      "\"Don't be stupid,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"We're coming,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "Harry pushed the door open. \n",
      "As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them. \n",
      "\"What's that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered. \n",
      "\"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\" \n",
      "\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes . . .\" \n",
      "He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. \n",
      "\"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \"I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog's back. \"Want to go first, Hermione?\" \n",
      "\"No, I don't!\" \n",
      "\"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. \n",
      "\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously. \n",
      "\"Nothing — just black — there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop.\" \n",
      "Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. \n",
      "\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\" \n",
      "Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. \n",
      "Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. \n",
      "He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\" \n",
      "\"Right,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"See you in a minute, I hope. . . .\" \n",
      "And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and — \n",
      "FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on  something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. \n",
      "\"It's okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it's a soft landing, you can jump!\" \n",
      "Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. \n",
      "\"What's this stuff?\" were his first words. \n",
      "\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\" \n",
      "The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side. \n",
      "\"We must be miles under the school,\" she said. \n",
      "\"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\" \n",
      "She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. \n",
      "Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. \n",
      "\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is — it's Devil's Snare!\" \n",
      "\"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \n",
      "\"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp —\" \n",
      "\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked. \n",
      "\"Yes — of course — but there's no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. \n",
      "\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \n",
      "\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. \n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis — 'there's no wood,' honestly.\" \n",
      "\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. \n",
      "All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough . . . \"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered. \n",
      "Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. \n",
      "\"Do you think it's a ghost?\" \n",
      "\"I don't know . . . sounds like wings to me.\" \n",
      "\"There's light ahead — I can see something moving.\" \n",
      "They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. \n",
      "\"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . well, there's no other choice . . . I'll run.\" \n",
      "He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. \n",
      "The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm. \n",
      "\"Now what?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"These birds . . . they can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering? \n",
      "\"They're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They're keys! Winged keys — look carefully. So that must mean . . .\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \". . . yes — look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\" \n",
      "\"But there are hundreds of them!\" \n",
      "Ron examined the lock on the door. \n",
      "\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the handle.\" \n",
      "They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. \n",
      "Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. \n",
      "\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\" \n",
      "Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. \n",
      "\"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down — and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\" \n",
      "Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against  the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber. \n",
      "They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned — it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. \n",
      "\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. \n",
      "The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. \n",
      "They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. \n",
      "\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered. \n",
      "\"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across the room.\" \n",
      "Behind the white pieces they could see another door. \n",
      "\"How?\" said Hermione nervously. \n",
      "\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\" \n",
      "He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. \n",
      "\"Do we — er — have to join you to get across?\" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. \n",
      "\"This needs thinking about. . . .\" he said. \"I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess —\" \n",
      "\"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\" \n",
      "\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.\" \n",
      "\"What about you?\" \n",
      "\"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Ron. \n",
      "The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. \n",
      "\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board. \"Yes . . . look . . .\" \n",
      "A white pawn had moved forward two squares. \n",
      "Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost? \n",
      "\"Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.\" \n",
      "Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. \n",
      "\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\" Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. \n",
      "\"We're nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think — let me think . . .\" \n",
      "The white queen turned her blank face toward him. \n",
      "\"Yes . . .\" said Ron softly, \"it's the only way . . . I've got to be taken.\" \n",
      "\"NO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted. \n",
      "\"That's chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You've got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and she'll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\" \n",
      "\"But —\" \n",
      "\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\" \n",
      "\"Ron —\" \n",
      "\"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\" \n",
      "There was no alternative. \n",
      "\"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go — now, don't hang around once you've won.\" \n",
      "He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out. \n",
      "Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. \n",
      "\"What if he's — ?\" \n",
      "\"He'll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do you reckon's next?\" \n",
      "\"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's . . .\" \n",
      "They had reached another door. \n",
      "\"All right?\" Harry whispered. \n",
      "\"Go on.\" \n",
      "Harry pushed it open. \n",
      "A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. \n",
      "\"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can't breathe.\" \n",
      "He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next — but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. \n",
      "\"Snape's,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\" \n",
      "They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped. \n",
      "\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: \n",
      "Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, \n",
      "Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, \n",
      "One among us seven will let you move ahead, \n",
      "Another will transport the drinker back instead, \n",
      "Two among our number hold only nettle wine, \n",
      "Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. \n",
      "Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, \n",
      "To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: \n",
      "First, however slyly the poison tries to hide \n",
      "You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; \n",
      "Second, different are those who stand at either end, \n",
      "But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; \n",
      "Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, \n",
      "Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; \n",
      "Fourth, the second left and the second on the right \n",
      "Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. \n",
      "Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing. \n",
      "\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn't magic — it's logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.\" \n",
      "\"But so will we, won't we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\" \n",
      "\"But how do we know which to drink?\" \n",
      "\"Give me a minute.\" \n",
      "Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands. \n",
      "\"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire — toward the Stone.\" \n",
      "Harry looked at the tiny bottle. \n",
      "\"There's only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That's hardly one swallow.\" \n",
      "They looked at each other. \n",
      "\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\" \n",
      "Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. \n",
      "\"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really.\" \n",
      "\"But Harry — what if You-Know-Who's with him?\" \n",
      "\"Well — I was lucky once, wasn't I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar. \"I might get lucky again.\" \n",
      "Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him. \"Hermione!\" \n",
      "\"Harry — you're a great wizard, you know.\" \n",
      "\"I'm not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. \n",
      "\"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!\" \n",
      "\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren't you?\" \n",
      "\"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \n",
      "\"It's not poison?\" said Harry anxiously. \n",
      "\"No — but it's like ice.\" \n",
      "\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\" \n",
      "\"Good luck — take care —\" \n",
      "\"GO!\" \n",
      "Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire. \n",
      "Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. \n",
      "\"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. \n",
      "It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other side, in the last chamber. \n",
      "There was already someone there — but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n",
      "It was Quirrell.  \"You!\" gasped Harry. Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all. \"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Potter.\" \"But I thought — Snape —\" \"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\" Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't. \"But Snape tried to kill me!\" \"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another \n",
      "few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\" \n",
      "\"Snape was trying to save me?\" \n",
      "\"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny, really . . . he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight.\" \n",
      "Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. \n",
      "\"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\" \n",
      "\"You let the troll in?\" \n",
      "\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly. \n",
      "\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\" \n",
      "It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. \n",
      "\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this . . . but he's in London . . . I'll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .\" \n",
      "All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror. \n",
      "\"I saw you and Snape in the forest —\" he blurted out. \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side. . . .\" \n",
      "Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. \n",
      "\"I see the Stone . . . I'm presenting it to my master . . . but where is it?\" \n",
      "Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror. \n",
      "\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\" \n",
      "\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was threatening you. \n",
      "For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face. \n",
      "\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master's instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak —\" \n",
      "\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped. \n",
      "\"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. . . . Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me . . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me. . . .\" \n",
      "Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. \n",
      "Quirrell cursed under his breath. \n",
      "\"I don't understand . . . is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\" \n",
      "Harry's mind was racing. \n",
      "What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it — which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to? \n",
      "He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\" \n",
      "And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself. \n",
      "\"Use the boy . . . Use the boy . . .\" \n",
      "Quirrell rounded on Harry. \n",
      "\"Yes — Potter — come here.\" \n",
      "He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. \n",
      "\"Come here,\" Quirrell repeated. \"Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.\" \n",
      "Harry walked toward him. \n",
      "I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that's all. \n",
      "Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. \n",
      "He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly — he'd gotten the Stone. \n",
      "\"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\" \n",
      "Harry screwed up his courage. \n",
      "\"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I — I've won the House Cup for Gryffindor.\" \n",
      "Quirrell cursed again. \n",
      "\"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? \n",
      "But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips. \n",
      "\"He lies . . . He lies . . .\" \n",
      "\"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What did you just see?\" \n",
      "The high voice spoke again. \n",
      "\"Let me speak to him . . . face-to-face. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Master, you are not strong enough!\" \n",
      "\"I have strength enough . . . for this. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot. \n",
      "Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter . . .\" it whispered. \n",
      "Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move. \n",
      "\"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor . . . I have form only when I can share another's body . . . but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds. . . . Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks . . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest . . . and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a  body of my own. . . . Now . . . why don't you give me that Stone in your pocket?\" \n",
      "So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He stumbled backward. \n",
      "\"Don't be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join me . . . or you'll meet the same end as your parents. . . . They died begging me for mercy. . . .\" \n",
      "\"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly. \n",
      "Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling. \n",
      "\"How touching . . .\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery. . . . Yes, boy, your parents were brave. . . . I killed your father first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but your mother needn't have died . . . she was trying to protect you. . . . Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\" \n",
      "\"NEVER!\" \n",
      "Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\" and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened — he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes. \n",
      "\"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harry's neck — Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. \n",
      "\"Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!\" \n",
      "And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. \n",
      "\"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort. \n",
      "Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face — \n",
      "\"AAAARGH!\" \n",
      "Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. \n",
      "Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry's head was building — he couldn't see — he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, \"KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, \"Harry! Harry!\" \n",
      "He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down . . . down . . . down . . . \n",
      "Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy. \n",
      "He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. \n",
      "He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him. \n",
      "\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir, quick —\" \n",
      "\"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said Dumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\" \n",
      "\"Then who does? Sir, I —\" \n",
      "\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\" \n",
      "Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. \n",
      "\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\" \n",
      "\"How long have I been in here?\" \n",
      "\"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\" \n",
      "\"But sir, the Stone —\" \n",
      "\"I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\" \n",
      "\"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?\" \n",
      "\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you —\" \n",
      "\"It was you.\" \n",
      "\"I feared I might be too late.\" \n",
      "\"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer —\" \n",
      "\"Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\" \n",
      "\"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend — Nicolas Flamel —\" \n",
      "\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.\" \n",
      "\"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?\" \n",
      "\"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face. \n",
      "\"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling. \n",
      "\"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I've been thinking . . . Sir — even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —\" \n",
      "\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\" \n",
      "\"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?\" \n",
      "\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share . . . not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\" \n",
      "Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \"Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can tell me . . . things I want to know the truth about. . . .\" \n",
      "\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\" \n",
      "\"Well . . . Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\" \n",
      "Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. \n",
      "\"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day . . . put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . . I know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, you will know.\" \n",
      "And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. \n",
      "\"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?\" \n",
      "\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign . . . to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \"And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent it to me?\" \n",
      "\"Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. \"Useful things . . . your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\" \n",
      "\"And there's something else . . .\" \n",
      "\"Fire away.\" \n",
      "\"Quirrell said Snape —\" \n",
      "\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\" \n",
      "\"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\" \n",
      "\"What?\" \n",
      "\"He saved his life.\" \n",
      "\"What?\" \n",
      "\"Yes . . .\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt. . . . I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. \n",
      "\"And sir, there's one more thing . . .\" \n",
      "\"Just the one?\" \n",
      "\"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\" \n",
      "\"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes. . . . Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking for them — but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't you?\" \n",
      "He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\" \n",
      "Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict. \n",
      "\"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded. \n",
      "\"Absolutely not.\" \n",
      "\"You let Professor Dumbledore in. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\" \n",
      "\"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey . . .\" \n",
      "\"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\" \n",
      "And she let Ron and Hermione in. \n",
      "\"Harry!\" \n",
      "Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. \n",
      "\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so worried —\" \n",
      "\"The whole school's talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\" \n",
      "It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud. \n",
      "\"So the Stone's gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel's just going to die?\" \n",
      "\"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? — 'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.' \" \n",
      "\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. \n",
      "\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor.\" \n",
      "\"D'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?\" \n",
      "\"Well,\" Hermione exploded, \"if he did — I mean to say — that's terrible — you could have been killed.\" \n",
      "\"No, it isn't,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly. \"Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food'll be good.\" \n",
      "At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. \n",
      "\"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,\" she said firmly. \n",
      "After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. \n",
      "\"I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. \"I can, can't I?\" \n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said sniffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\" \n",
      "Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears. \n",
      "\"It's — all — my — ruddy — fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands. \"I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!\" \n",
      "\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him.\" \n",
      "\"Yeh could've died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An' don' say the name!\" \n",
      "\"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \"I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I've got loads. . . .\" \n",
      "Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds me. I've got yeh a present.\" \n",
      "\"It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got yeh this . . .\" \n",
      "It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father. \n",
      "\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos . . . knew yeh didn' have any . . . d'yeh like it?\" \n",
      "Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood. \n",
      "Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table. \n",
      "When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. \n",
      "Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away. \n",
      "\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts. . . . \n",
      "\"Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\" \n",
      "A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. \n",
      "\"Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\" \n",
      "The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little. \n",
      "\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes . . . \n",
      "\"First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley . . .\" \n",
      "Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn. \n",
      "\". . . for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.\" \n",
      "Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!\" \n",
      "At last there was silence again. \n",
      "\"Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.\" \n",
      "Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves — they were a hundred points up. \"Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. \". . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.\" \n",
      "The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point. \n",
      "Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. \n",
      "\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\" \n",
      "Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him. \n",
      "\"Which means,\" Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\" \n",
      "He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was \n",
      "shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. \n",
      "It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls . . . he would never, ever forget tonight. \n",
      "Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life. \n",
      "And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they'll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross station. It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \n",
      "\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you — I'll send you an owl.\" \n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I'll need something to look forward to.\" \n",
      "People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: \n",
      "\"Bye, Harry!\" \n",
      "\"See you, Potter!\" \n",
      "\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him. \n",
      "\"Not where I'm going, I promise you,\" said Harry. \n",
      "He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \n",
      "\"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\" \n",
      "It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see —\" \n",
      "\"Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point.\" \n",
      "Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them. \n",
      "\"Busy year?\" she said. \n",
      "\"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\" \n",
      "\"Ready, are you?\" \n",
      "It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in \n",
      "a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia \n",
      "and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. \n",
      "\"You must be Harry's family!\" said Mrs. Weasley. \n",
      "\"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day.\" He walked away. \n",
      "Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione. \n",
      "\"See you over the summer, then.\" \n",
      "\"Hope you have — er — a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. \n",
      "\"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \"They don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer. . . .\"\n",

      "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\" Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing . . .\" Dudley's birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he  wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\" Don't ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put  together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\" Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty . . . thirty . . .\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction. Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. \"What about what's-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \". . . and leave him in the car. . . .\" \"That cars new, he's not sitting in it alone. . . .\" Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying — it had been years since he'd really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I . . . don't . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly . . .\" But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \". . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don't,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" The snake nodded vigorously. \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see — so you've never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He  couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n"

      "Clutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn't stop grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it. \"Seats a hundred thousand,\" said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on Harry's face. \"Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they've suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again . . . bless them,\" he added fondly, leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards. \"Prime seats!\" said the Ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets. \"Top Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.\" The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They clambered upward with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley's party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts. About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined. A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field. Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. The field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of the field stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry's eye level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giant's hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field. The Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family — safe, reliable, and with Built-in Anti-Burglar Buzzer . . . Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No Pain, No Stain! . . . Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris, Hogsmeade . . . Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them. The creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . . \"Dobby?\" said Harry incredulously. The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn't Dobby — it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry's friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family. \"Did sir just call me Dobby?\" squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby's had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected — though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf — that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest. \"Sorry,\" Harry told the elf, \"I just thought you were someone I knew.\" \"But I knows Dobby too, sir!\" squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit. \"My name is Winky, sir — and you, sir —\" Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry's scar. \"You is surely Harry Potter!\" \"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry. \"But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!\" she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck. \"How is he?\" said Harry. \"How's freedom suiting him?\" \"Ah, sir,\" said Winky, shaking her head, \"ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.\" \"Why?\" said Harry, taken aback. \"What's wrong with him?\" \"Freedom is going to Dobby's head, sir,\" said Winky sadly. \"Ideas above his station, sir. Can't get another position, sir.\" \"Why not?\" said Harry. Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, \"He is wanting paying for his work, sir.\" \"Paying?\" said Harry blankly. \"Well — why shouldn't he be paid?\" Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden again. \"House-elves is not paid, sir!\" she said in a muffled squeak. \"No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you's up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.\" \"Well, it's about time he had a bit of fun,\" said Harry. \"House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,\" said Winky firmly, from behind her hands. \"House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter\" — she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped — \"but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.\" \"Why's he sent you up here, if he knows you don't like heights?\" said Harry, frowning. \"Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very busy,\" said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her. \"Winky is wishing she is back in master's tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.\" She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again. Harry turned back to the others. \"So that's a house-elf?\" Ron muttered. \"Weird things, aren't they?\" \"Dobby was weirder,\" said Harry fervently. Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium. \"Wild!\" he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. \"I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again . . . and again . . . and again . . .\" Hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvet-covered, tasseled program. \" 'A display from the team mascots will precede the match,' \" she read aloud. \"Oh that's always worth watching,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.\" The box filled gradually around them over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards. Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself, arrived, Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. Highly embarrassed, he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like an old friend. They had met before, and Fudge shook Harry's hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him. \"Harry Potter, you know,\" he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn't seem to understand a word of English. \"Harry Potter . . . oh come on now, you know who he is . . . the boy who survived You-Know-Who . . . you do know who he is —\" The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry's scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it. \"Knew we'd get there in the end,\" said Fudge wearily to Harry. \"I'm no great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see his house-elf's saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here's Lucius!\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the house-elf's former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco's mother. Harry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly resembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have been nice-looking if she hadn't been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose. \"Ah, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the Minister of Magic. \"How are you? I don't think you've met my wife, Narcissa? Or our son, Draco?\" \"How do you do, how do you do?\" said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs. Malfoy. \"And allow me to introduce you to Mr. Oblansk — Obalonsk — Mr. — well, he's the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he can't understand a word I'm saying anyway, so never mind. And let's see who else — you know Arthur Weasley, I daresay?\" It was a tense moment. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy looked at each other and Harry vividly recalled the last time they had come face-to-face: It had been in Flourish and Blotts' bookshop, and they had had a fight. Mr. Malfoy's cold gray eyes swept over Mr. Weasley, and then up and down the row. \"Good lord, Arthur,\" he said softly. \"What did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn't have fetched this much?\" Fudge, who wasn't listening, said, \"Lucius has just given a very generous contribution to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur. He's here as my guest.\" \"How — how nice,\" said Mr. Weasley, with a very strained smile. Mr. Malfoy's eyes had returned to Hermione, who went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at him. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr. Malfoy's lip curl like that. The Malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, second-class. However, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic, Mr. Malfoy did-n't dare say anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley and continued down the line to his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron, and Hermione one contemptuous look, then settled himself between his mother and father. \"Slimy gits,\" Ron muttered as he, Harry, and Hermione turned to face the field again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box. \"Everyone ready?\" he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam. \"Minister — ready to go?\" \"Ready when you are, Ludo,\" said Fudge comfortably. Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said \"Sonorus!\" and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands. \"Ladies and gentlemen . . . welcome! Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!\" The spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans — A Risk With Every Mouthful!) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0. \"And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce . . . the Bulgarian National Team Mascots!\" The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval. \"I wonder what they've brought,\" said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his seat. \"Aaah!\" He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. \"Veela!\" \"What are veel — ?\" But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry's question was answered for him. Veela were women . . . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen . . . except that they weren't — they couldn't be — human. This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind . . . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human — in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all. The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. . . . And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea . . . but would it be good enough? \"Harry, what are you doing?\" said Hermione's voice from a long way off. The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard. Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn't want the  veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands. \"You'll be wanting that,\" he said, \"once Ireland have had their say. \"Huh?\" said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field. Hermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back into his seat. \"Honestly!\" she said. \"And now,\" roared Ludo Bagman's voice, \"kindly put your wands in the air . . . for the Irish National Team Mascots!\" Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came zooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts. A rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands. Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it — \"Excellent!\" yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats. Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green. \"Leprechauns!\" said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold. \"There you go,\" Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry's hand, \"for the Omnioculars! Now you've got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!\" The great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to watch the match. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome — the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you — Dimitrov!\" A scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian supporters. \"Ivanova!\" A second scarlet-robed player zoomed out. \"Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand — Krum!\" \"That's him, that's him!\" yelled Ron, following Krum with his Omnioculars. Harry quickly focused his own. Viktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to believe he was only eighteen. \"And now, please greet — the Irish National Quidditch Team!\" yelled Bagman. \"Presenting — Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand — Lynch!\" Seven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a small dial on the side of his Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word \"Firebolt\" on each of their brooms and see their names, embroidered in silver, upon their backs. \"And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!\" A small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival Uncle Vernon's, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other. Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open — four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls. \"Theeeeeeeey're OFF!\" screamed Bagman. \"And it's Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!\" It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose. The speed of the players was incredible — the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names. Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums. HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran's path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it — \"TROY SCORES!\" roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. \"Ten zero to Ireland!\" \"What?\" Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. \"But Levski's got the Quaffle!\" \"Harry, if you're not going to watch at normal speed, you're going to miss things!\" shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omni-oculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily. Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed. Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another's minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry's chest kept squeaking their names: \"Troy — Mullet — Moran!\" And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters. The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria's first goal. \"Fingers in your ears!\" bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle. \"Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova — oh I say!\" roared Bagman. One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was — \"They're going to crash!\" screamed Hermione next to Harry. She was half right — at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats. \"Fool!\" moaned Mr. Weasley. \"Krum was feinting!\" \"It's time-out!\" yelled Bagman's voice, \"as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan Lynch!\" \"He'll be okay, he only got ploughed!\" Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. \"Which is what Krum was after, of course. . . .\" Harry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes. He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. WRONSKI DEFENSIVE FEINT — DANGEROUS SEEKER DIVERSION read the shining purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum's face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood — Krum hadn't seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum's face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference. Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters, mounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far. After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals. They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier. As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn't catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa's long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul. \"And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing — excessive use of elbows!\" Bagman informed the roaring spectators. \"And — yes, it's a penalty to Ireland!\" The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words \"HA, HA, HA!\" The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again. As one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers into their ears, but Hermione, who hadn't bothered, was soon tugging on Harry's arm. He turned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears. \"Look at the referee!\" she said, giggling. Harry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly. \"Now, we can't have that!\" said Ludo Bagman, though he sounded highly amused. \"Somebody slap the referee!\" A mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own ears, and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself; Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous. \"And unless I'm much mistaken, Mostafa is actually attempting to send off the Bulgarian team mascots!\" said Bagman's voice. \"Now there's something we haven't seen before. . . . Oh this could turn nasty. . . .\" It did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, landed on either side of Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him, gesticulating toward the leprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words \"HEE, HEE, HEE.\" Mostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarians' arguments, however; he was jabbing his finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and when they refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle. \"Two penalties for Ireland!\" shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd howled with anger. \"And Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms . . . yes . . . there they go . . . and Troy takes the Quaffle . . .\" Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom. \"Foul !\" roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green. \"Foul!\" echoed Ludo Bagman's magically magnified voice. \"Dimitrov skins Moran — deliberately flying to collide there — and it's got to be another penalty — yes, there's the whistle!\" The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn't look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders — \"And that, boys,\" yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, \"is why you should never go for looks alone!\" Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above. Harry turned this way and that, staring through his Omnioculars, as the Quaffle changed hands with the speed of a bullet. \"Levski — Dimitrov — Moran — Troy — Mullet — Ivanova — Moran again — Moran — MORAN SCORES!\" But the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela, the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members' wands, and the furious roars of the Bulgarians. The game recommenced immediately; now Levski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov — The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in the face. There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum's nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn't blow his whistle. He had become distracted, and Harry couldn't blame him; one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight. Harry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured; even though he was supporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting player on the field. Ron obviously felt the same. \"Time-out! Ah, come on, he can't play like that, look at him —\" \"Look at Lynch!\" Harry yelled. For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry  was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing. . . . \"He's seen the Snitch!\" Harry shouted. \"He's seen it! Look at him go!\" Half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening; the Irish supporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on . . . but Krum was on his tail. How he could see where he was going, Harry had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again — \"They're going to crash!\" shrieked Hermione. \"They're not!\" roared Ron. \"Lynch is!\" yelled Harry. And he was right — for the second time, Lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela. \"The Snitch, where's the Snitch?\" bellowed Charlie, along the row. \"He's got it — Krum's got it — it's all over!\" shouted Harry. Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand. The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170 across the crowd, who didn't seem to have realized what had happened. Then, slowly, as though a great jumbo jet were revving up, the rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight. \"IRELAND WINS!\" Bagman shouted, who like the Irish, seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match.  \"KRUM GETS THE SNITCH — BUT IRELAND WINS — good lord, I don't think any of us were expecting that!\" \"What did he catch the Snitch for?\" Ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and down, applauding with his hands over his head. \"He ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!\" \"He knew they were never going to catch up!\" Harry shouted back over all the noise, also applauding loudly. \"The Irish Chasers were too good. . . . He wanted to end it on his terms, that's all. . . .\" \"He was very brave, wasn't he?\" Hermione said, leaning forward to watch Krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him. \"He looks a terrible mess. . . .\" Harry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was hard to see what was happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards. He looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up. His team members were around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the Irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots. Flags were waving all over the stadium, the Irish national anthem blared from all sides; the veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn. \"Vell, ve fought bravely,\" said a gloomy voice behind Harry. He looked around; it was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic. \"You can speak English!\" said Fudge, sounding outraged. \"And you've been letting me mime everything all day!\" \"Vell, it vos very funny,\" said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging. \"And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!\" roared Bagman. Harry's eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside. Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he'd been using sign language all day for nothing. \"Let's have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!\" Bagman shouted. And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction. One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground. He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when Krum's name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar. And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused. But he grinned  happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Harry's hands were numb with clapping. At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Connolly's, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, \"Quietus.\" \"They'll be talking about this one for years,\" he said hoarsely, \"a really unexpected twist, that. . . . shame it couldn't have lasted longer. . . . Ah yes. . . . yes, I owe you . . . how much?\" For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched.\n",

      "Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he'd received a huge electric shock. \"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's chest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you. . . .\" Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. \"You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\" he said, his eyes glittering. \"I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did . . . lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.\" \"Severus —\" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him. \"I've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here's the proof.  Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout —\" \"Severus, you're making a mistake,\" said Lupin urgently. \"You haven't heard everything — I can explain — Sirius is not here to kill Harry —\" \"Two more for Azkaban tonight,\" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. \"I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this. . . . He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin . . . a tame werewolf —\" \"You fool,\" said Lupin softly. \"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\" BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black's eyes. \"Give me a reason,\" he whispered. \"Give me a reason to do it, and I swear I will.\" Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred. Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very breathless voice, \"Professor Snape — it — it wouldn't hurt to hear what they've got to say, w — would it?\" \"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\" Snape spat. \"You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your tongue.\" \"But if — if there was a mistake —\" \"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!\" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. \"DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!\" A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's face. Hermione fell silent. \"Vengeance is very sweet,\" Snape breathed at Black. \"How I hoped I would be the one to catch you. . . .\" \"The joke's on you again, Severus,\" Black snarled. \"As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle\" — he jerked his head at Ron — \"I'll come quietly. . . .\" \"Up to the castle?\" said Snape silkily. \"I don't think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow. They'll be very pleased to see you, Black . . . pleased enough to give you a little kiss, I daresay. . . .\" What little color there was in Black's face left it. \"You — you've got to hear me out,\" he croaked. \"The rat — look at the rat —\" But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason. \"Come on, all of you,\" he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \"I'll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too —\" Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door. \"Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,\" snarled Snape. \"If I hadn't been here to save your skin —\" \"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\" Harry said. \"I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he just finish me off then?\" \"Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,\" hissed Snape. \"Get out of the way, Potter.\" \"YOU'RE PATHETIC!\" Harry yelled. \"JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN —\" \"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!\" Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. \"Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black — now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!\" Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step toward him, he had raised his wand. \"Expelliarmus!\" he yelled — except that his wasn't the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out. Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks. \"You shouldn't have done that,\" said Black, looking at Harry. \"You should have left him to me. . . .\" Harry avoided Black's eyes. He wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done the right thing. \"We attacked a teacher. . . . We attacked a teacher . . . ,\" Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \"Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble —\" Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them. \"Thank you, Harry,\" he said. \"I'm still not saying I believe you,\" he told Lupin. \"Then it's time we offered you some proof,\" said Lupin. \"You, boy — give me Peter, please. Now.\" Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest. \"Come off it,\" he said weakly. \"Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean . . .\" He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support, \"Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how's he supposed to know which one he's after if he was locked up in Azkaban?\" \"You know, Sirius, that's a fair question,\" said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly. \"How did you find out where he was?\" Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others. It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron's shoulder, was Scabbers. \"How did you get this?\" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck. \"Fudge,\" said Black. \"When he came to inspect Azkaban last  year, he gave me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page . . . on this boy's shoulder. . . . I knew him at once . . . how many times had I seen him transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts . . . to where Harry was. . . .\" \"My God,\" said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again. \"His front paw . . .\" \"What about it?\" said Ron defiantly. \"He's got a toe missing,\" said Black. \"Of course,\" Lupin breathed. \"So simple . . . so brilliant . . . he cut it off himself?\" \"Just before he transformed,\" said Black. \"When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself — and sped down into the sewer with the other rats. . . . \"Didn't you ever hear, Ron?\" said Lupin. \"The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger.\" \"Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He's been in my family for ages, right —\" \"Twelve years, in fact,\" said Lupin. \"Didn't you ever wonder why he was living so long?\" \"We — we've been taking good care of him!\" said Ron. \"Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?\" said Lupin. \"I'd guess he's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again. . . .\" \"He's been scared of that mad cat!\" said Ron, nodding toward Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed. But that wasn't right, Harry thought suddenly. . . . Scabbers had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks . . . ever since Ron's return from Egypt . . . since the time when Black had escaped. . . . \"This cat isn't mad,\" said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head. \"He's the most intelligent of his kind I've ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted me. . . . Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and he's been helping me. . . .\" \"What do you mean?\" breathed Hermione. \"He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn't . . . so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me. . . . As I understand it, he took them from a boy's bedside table. . . .\" Harry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing. It was absurd . . . and yet . . . \"But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it. . . .\" croaked Black. \"This cat — Crookshanks, did you call him? — told me Peter had left blood on the sheets. . . . I supposed he bit himself. . . . Well, faking his own death had worked once. . . .\" These words jolted Harry to his senses. \"And why did he fake his death?\" he said furiously. \"Because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents!\" \"No,\" said Lupin, \"Harry —\" \"And now you've come to finish him off!\" \"Yes, I have,\" said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers. \"Then I should've let Snape take you!\" Harry shouted. \"Harry,\" said Lupin hurriedly, \"don't you see? All this time  we've thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down — but it was the other way around, don't you see? Peter betrayed your mother and father — Sirius tracked Peter down —\" \"THAT'S NOT TRUE!\" Harry yelled. \"HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!\" He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes were suddenly overbright. \"Harry . . . I as good as killed them,\" he croaked. \"I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me. . . . I'm to blame, I know it. . . . The night they died, I'd arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his hiding place, he'd gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It didn't feel right. I was scared. I set out for your parents' house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and their bodies . . . I realized what Peter must've done . . . what I'd done. . . .\" His voice broke. He turned away. \"Enough of this,\" said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before. \"There's one certain way to prove what really happened. Ron, give me that rat.\" \"What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?\" Ron asked Lupin tensely. \"Force him to show himself,\" said Lupin. \"If he really is a rat, it won't hurt him.\" Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. \"Ready, Sirius?\" said Lupin. Black had already retrieved Snape's wand from the bed. He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face. \"Together?\" he said quietly. \"I think so,\" said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other. \"On the count of three. One — two — THREE!\" A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment, Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly — Ron yelled — the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding flash of light and then — It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was standing up. He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers's fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again. \"Well, hello, Peter,\" said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him. \"Long time, no see.\" \"S — Sirius . . . R — Remus . . .\" Even Pettigrew's voice was squeaky. Again, his eyes darted toward the door. \"My friends . . . my old friends . . .\" Black's wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a warning look, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual. \"We've been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed —\" \"Remus,\" gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, \"you don't believe him, do you. . . ? He tried to kill me, Remus. . . .\" \"So we've heard,\" said Lupin, more coldly. \"I'd like to clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if you'd be so —\" \"He's come to try and kill me again!\" Pettigrew squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because his index was missing. \"He killed Lily and James and now he's going to kill me too. . . . You've got to help me, Remus. . . .\" Black's face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes. \"No one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few things out,\" said Lupin. \"Sorted things out?\" squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again, the only door. \"I knew he'd come after me! I knew he'd be back for me! I've been waiting for this for twelve years!\" \"You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?\" said Lupin, his brow furrowed. \"When nobody has ever done it before?\" \"He's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!\" Pettigrew shouted shrilly. \"How else did he get out of there? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!\" Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the whole room. \"Voldemort, teach me tricks?\" he said. Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him. \"What, scared to hear your old master's name?\" said Black. \"I don't blame you, Peter. His lot aren't very happy with you, are they?\" \"Don't know what you mean, Sirius —\" muttered Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now. \"You haven't been hiding from me for twelve years,\" said Black. \"You've been hiding from Voldemort's old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter. . . . They all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them. . . . I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters' on your information . . . and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort's supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they've seen the error of their ways. . . . If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter —\" \"Don't know . . . what you're talking about. . . ,\" said Pettigrew again, more shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. \"You don't believe this — this madness, Remus —\" \"I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,\" said Lupin evenly. \"Innocent, but scared!\" squealed Pettigrew. \"If Voldemort's supporters were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban — the spy, Sirius Black!\" Black's face contorted. \"How dare you,\" he growled, sounding suddenly like the bear-sized dog he had been. \"I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter — I'll never understand why I didn't see you were the spy from the start. You always liked big friends who'd look after you, didn't you? It used to be us . . . me and Remus . . . and James. . . .\" Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath. \"Me, a spy . . . must be out of your mind . . . never . . . don't know how you can say such a —\" \"Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,\" Black hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward. \"I thought it was the perfect plan . . . a bluff. . . . Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they'd use a weak, talentless thing like you. . . . It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.\" Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like \"far-fetched\" and \"lunacy,\" but he couldn't help paying more attention to the ashen color of Pettigrew's face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door. \"Professor Lupin?\" said Hermione timidly. \"Can — can I say something?\" \"Certainly, Hermione,\" said Lupin courteously. \"Well — Scabbers — I mean, this — this man — he's been sleeping in Harry's dormitory for three years. If he's working for YouKnow-Who, how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?\" \"There!\" said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed hand. \"Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry's head! Why should I?\" \"I'll tell you why,\" said Black. \"Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort's been in hiding for fifteen years, they say he's half dead. You weren't about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore's nose, for a wreck of a wizard who'd lost all of his power, were you? You'd want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him, wouldn't you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren't you, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him. . . .\" Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to have lost the ability to talk. \"Er — Mr. Black — Sirius?\" said Hermione. Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her. \"If you don't mind me asking, how — how did you get out of Azkaban, if you didn't use Dark Magic?\" \"Thank you!\" gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. \"Exactly! Precisely what I —\" But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly at Hermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He seemed to be pondering his answer. \"I don't know how I did it,\" he said slowly. \"I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn't a happy thought, so the dementors couldn't suck it out of me . . . but it kept me sane and knowing who I am . . . helped me keep my powers . . . so when it all became . . . too much . . . I could transform in my cell . . . become a dog. Dementors can't see, you know. . . .\" He swallowed. \"They feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions. . . . They could tell that my feelings were less — less human, less complex when I was a dog . . . but they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there, so it didn't trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand. . . . \"But then I saw Peter in that picture . . . I realized he was at Hogwarts with Harry . . . perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again. . . .\" Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all the while at Black as though hypnotized. \". . . ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies . . . and to deliver the last Potter to them. If he gave them Harry, who'd dare say he'd betrayed Lord Voldemort? He'd be welcomed back with honors. . . . \"So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive. . . .\" Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley. \"The guards say he's been talking in his sleep . . . always the same words . . . 'He's at Hogwarts.'\" \"It was as if someone had lit a fire in my head, and the dementors couldn't destroy it. . . . It wasn't a happy feeling . . . it was an obsession . . . but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog. . . . It's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused. . . . I was thin, very thin . . . thin enough to slip through the bars. . . . I swam as a dog back to the mainland. . . . I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I've been living in the forest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course. You fly as well as your father did, Harry. . . .\" He looked at Harry, who did not look away. \"Believe me,\" croaked Black. \"Believe me, Harry. I never betrayed James and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them.\" And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he nodded. \"No!\" Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry's nod had been his own death sentence. He shuffled forward on his knees, groveling, his hands clasped in front of him as though praying. \"Sirius — it's me . . . it's Peter . . . your friend . . . you wouldn't . . .\" Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled. \"There's enough filth on my robes without you touching them,\" said Black. \"Remus!\" Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing imploringly in front of him. \"You don't believe this . . . wouldn't Sirius have told you they'd changed the plan?\" \"Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,\" said Lupin. \"I assume that's why you didn't tell me, Sirius?\" he said casually over Pettigrew's head. \"Forgive me, Remus,\" said Black. \"Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,\" said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves. \"And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were the spy?\" \"Of course,\" said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. \"Shall we kill him together?\" \"Yes, I think so,\" said Lupin grimly. \"You wouldn't . . . you won't. . . ,\" gasped Pettigrew. And he scrambled around to Ron. \"Ron . . . haven't I been a good friend . . . a good pet? You won't let them kill me, Ron, will you . . . you're on my side, aren't you?\" But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion. \"I let you sleep in my bed!\" he said. \"Kind boy . . . kind master . . .\" Pettigrew crawled toward Ron, \"you won't let them do it. . . . I was your rat. . . . I was a good pet. . . .\" \"If you made a better rat than a human, it's not much to boast about, Peter,\" said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew's reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees, staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione's robes. \"Sweet girl . . . clever girl . . . you — you won't let them. . . . Help me. . . .\" Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew's clutching hands and backed away against the wall, looking horrified. Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and turned his head slowly toward Harry. \"Harry . . . Harry . . . you look just like your father . . . just like him. . . .\" \"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?\" roared Black. \"HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?\" \"Harry,\" whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched. \"Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed. . . . James would have understood, Harry . . . he would have shown me mercy. . . .\" Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew's shoulders, and threw him backward onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror, staring up at them. \"You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,\" said Black, who was shaking too. \"Do you deny it?\" Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor. \"Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord . . . you have no idea . . . he has weapons you can't imagine. . . . I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen. . . . He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me —\" \"DON'T LIE!\" bellowed Black. \"YOU'D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!\" \"He — he was taking over everywhere!\" gasped Pettigrew. \"Wh — what was there to be gained by refusing him?\" \"What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?\" said Black, with a terribly fury in his face. \"Only innocent lives, Peter!\" \"You don't understand!\" whined Pettigrew. \"He would have killed me, Sirius!\" \"THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!\" roared Black. \"DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!\" Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised. \"You should have realized,\" said Lupin quietly, \"if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter.\" Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall. \"NO!\" Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front of Pettigrew, facing the wands. \"You can't kill him,\" he said breathlessly. \"You can't.\" Black and Lupin both looked staggered. \"Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents,\" Black snarled. \"This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too, without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family.\" \"I know,\" Harry panted. \"We'll take him up to the castle. We'll hand him over to the dementors. . . . He can go to Azkaban . . . but don't kill him.\" \"Harry!\" gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry's knees. \"You — thank you — it's more than I deserve — thank you —\" \"Get off me,\" Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew's hands off him in  disgust. \"I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it because — I don't reckon my dad would've wanted them to become killers — just for you.\" No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at each other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands. \"You're the only person who has the right to decide, Harry,\" said Black. \"But think . . . think what he did. . . .\" \"He can go to Azkaban,\" Harry repeated. \"If anyone deserves that place, he does. . . .\" Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him. \"Very well,\" said Lupin. \"Stand aside, Harry.\" Harry hesitated. \"I'm going to tie him up,\" said Lupin. \"That's all, I swear.\" Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin's wand this time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged. \"But if you transform, Peter,\" growled Black, his own wand pointing at Pettigrew too, \"we will kill you. You agree, Harry?\" Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him. \"Right,\" said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. \"Ron, I can't mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it's best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.\" He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron's leg with his wand, and muttered, \"Ferula.\" Bandages spun up Ron's leg,  strapping it tightly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn't wince. \"That's better,\" he said. \"Thanks.\" \"What about Professor Snape?\" said Hermione in a small voice, looking down at Snape's prone figure. \"There's nothing seriously wrong with him,\" said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse. \"You were just a little — overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er — perhaps it will be best if we don't revive him until we're safely back in the castle. We can take him like this. . . .\" He muttered, \"Mobilicorpus.\" As though invisible strings were tied to Snape's wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position, head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket. \"And two of us should be chained to this,\" said Black, nudging Pettigrew with his toe. \"Just to make sure.\" \"I'll do it,\" said Lupin. \"And me,\" said Ron savagely, limping forward. Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright again, left arm chained to Lupin's right, right arm to Ron's left. Ron's face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers's true identity as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high.\n",

      "Harry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way, and he fell forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his head. \"Where are we?\" he said. Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they looked around. They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously traveled miles — perhaps hundreds of miles — for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone. They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside. Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry. \"Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?\" he asked. \"Nope,\" said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was completely silent and slightly eerie. \"Is this supposed to be part of the task?\" \"I dunno,\" said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. \"Wands out, d'you reckon?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him. They pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. He had, yet again, the strange feeling that they were being watched. \"Someone's coming,\" he said suddenly. Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward them between the graves. Harry couldn't make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something. Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And — several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time — Harry saw that the thing in the person's arms looked like a baby . . . or was it merely a bundle of robes? Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure. It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For a second, Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another. And then, without warning, Harry's scar exploded with pain. It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open. From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, \"Kill the spare.\" A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night: \"Avada Kedavra!\" A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes. Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead. For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric's face, at his open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at his half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised. And then, before Harry's mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet. The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it. qlj=ofaaib= The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry, tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing from the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man hit him — hit him with a hand that had a finger missing. And Harry realized who was under the hood. It was Wormtail. \"You!\" he gasped. But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, fumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn't move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry's mouth; then, without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn't make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone; he couldn't turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him. Cedric's body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry's wand was on the ground at Cedric's feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again . . . and he suddenly knew that he didn't want to see what was in those robes . . . he didn't want that bundle opened. . . . He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied. Wormtail's fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came back within Harry's range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water — Harry couldCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO hear it slopping around — and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a full-grown man to sit in. The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Worm-tail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly there were crackling flames beneath it. The large snake slithered away into the darkness. The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam was thickening, blurring the outline of Worm-tail tending the fire. The movements beneath the robes became more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice again. \"Hurry!\" The whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It might have been encrusted with diamonds. \"It is ready, Master.\" \"Now . . .\" said the cold voice. Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them, and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouth. It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind — but worse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face — no child alive ever had a face like that — flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes. The thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them around Wormtail's neck, and Wormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood fell back, and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail's weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron. For one moment, Harry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion. And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and it vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud. Let it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance, please . . . let it drown. . . . Wormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed frightened beyond his wits. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night. \"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!\" The surface of the grave at Harry's feet cracked. Horrified, Harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail's command and fell softly into the cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed; it sent sparks in all directions and turned a vivid, poisonous-looking blue. And now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin, shining silver dagger from inside his cloak. His voice broke into petrified sobs. \"Flesh — of the servant — w-willingly given — you will — revive — your master.\" He stretched his right hand out in front of him — the hand with the missing finger. He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward. Harry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before itCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO happened — he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through Harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too. He heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail's anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron. Harry couldn't stand to look . . . but the potion had turned a burning red; the light of it shone through Harry's closed eyelids. . . . Wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not until Harry felt Wormtail's anguished breath on his face did he realize that Wormtail was right in front of him. \"B-blood of the enemy . . . forcibly taken . . . you will . . . resurrect your foe.\" Harry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly. . . . Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtail's remaining hand. He felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes. Wormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry's cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it. He staggered back to the cauldron with Harry's blood. He poured it inside. The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white. Wormtail, his job done, dropped to his knees beside the cauldron, then slumped sideways and lay on the ground, cradling the bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing. The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness. Nothing happened. . . . Let it have drowned, Harry thought, let it have gone wrong. . . . And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of Harry, so that he couldn't see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air. . . . It's gone wrong, he thought . . . it's drowned . . . please . . . please let it be dead. . . . But then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the cauldron. \"Robe me,\" said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached up, and pulled them one-handed over his master's head. The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry . . . and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snake's with slits for nostrils . . . Lord Voldemort had risen again.\n",

      "Harry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it before, he had been here before: This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore's Pensieve, the place where he had watched the Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty benches rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell. A cold male voice rang across the courtroom. \"You're late.\" \"Sorry,\" said Harry nervously. \"I-I didn't know the time had changed.\" \"That is not the Wizengamot's fault,\" said the voice. \"An owl was sent to you this morning. Take your seat.\" Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room, the arms of which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked rather threateningly but did not bind him. Feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the bench above. There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing plum-colored robes with an elaborately worked silver W on the left-hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity. In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair sat on Fudge's left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudge's right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow. \"Very well,\" said Fudge. \"The accused being present — finally — let us begin. Are you ready?\" he called down the row. \"Yes, sir,\" said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron's brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy's eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand. \"Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,\" said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, \"into offenses committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. \"Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley —\" \"— Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,\" said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck. Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose. The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in welcome. A powerful emotion had risen in Harry's chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore's eye, but Dumbledore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge. \"Ah,\" said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. \"Dumbledore. Yes. You — er — got our — er — message that the time and — er — place of the hearing had been changed, then?\" \"I must have missed it,\" said Dumbledore cheerfully. \"However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.\" \"Yes — well — I suppose we'll need another chair — I — Weasley, could you — ?\" \"Not to worry, not to worry,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle down. \"Yes,\" said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. \"Well, then. So. The charges. Yes.\" He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took a deep breath, and read, \"The charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on August the second at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offense under paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thirteen of the International Confederation of Wizards' Statute of Secrecy. \"You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?\" Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his parchment. \"Yes,\" Harry said. \"You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did you not?\" \"Yes, but —\" \"And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August?\" said Fudge. \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but —\" \"Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen?\" \"Yes, but —\" \"Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?\" \"Yes, but —\" \"Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time? \"Yes,\" said Harry angrily, \"but I only used it because we were —\" The witch with the monocle on Fudge's left cut across him in a booming voice. \"You produced a fully fledged Patronus?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"because —\" \"A corporeal Patronus?\" \"A — what?\" said Harry. \"Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more than vapor or smoke?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, \"it's a stag, it's always a stag.\" \"Always?\" boomed Madam Bones. \"You have produced a Patronus before now?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"I've been doing it for over a year —\" \"And you are fifteen years old?\" \"Yes, and —\" \"You learned this at school?\" \"Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —\" \"Impressive,\" said Madam Bones, staring down at him, \"a true Patronus at that age . . . very impressive indeed.\" Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads. \"It's not a question of how impressive the magic was,\" said Fudge in a testy voice. \"In fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!\" Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but it was the sight of Percy's sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into speech. \"I did it because of the dementors!\" he said loudly, before anyone could interrupt him again. He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before. \"Dementors?\" said Madam Bones after a moment, raising her thick eyebrows so that her monocle looked in danger of falling out. \"What do you mean, boy?\" \"I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin!\" \"Ah,\" said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. \"Yes. Yes, I thought we'd be hearing something like this.\" \"Dementors in Little Whinging?\" Madam Bones said in tones of great surprise. \"I don't understand —\" \"Don't you, Amelia?\" said Fudge, still smirking. \"Let me explain. He's been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can't see dementors, can they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient . . . so it's just your word and no witnesses. . . .\" \"I'm not lying!\" said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of muttering from the court. \"There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it —\" \"Enough, enough!\" said Fudge with a very supercilious look on his face. \"I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story —\" Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again. \"We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway,\" he said, \"other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.\" Fudge's plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, \"We haven't got time to listen to more taradiddles, I'm afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly —\" \"I may be wrong,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly, \"but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to  present witnesses for his or her case? Isn't that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?\" he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle. \"True,\" said Madam Bones. \"Perfectly true.\" \"Oh, very well, very well,\" snapped Fudge. \"Where is this person?\" \"I brought her with me,\" said Dumbledore. \"She's just outside the door. Should I — ?\" \"No — Weasley, you go,\" Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, hurried down the stone steps from the judge's balcony, and hastened past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them. A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. Figg. She looked scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers. Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself. \"Full name?\" said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat. \"Arabella Doreen Figg,\" said Mrs. Figg in her quavery voice. \"And who exactly are you?\" said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice. \"I'm a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,\" said Mrs. Figg. \"We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging other than Harry Potter,\" said Madam Bones at once. \"That situation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.\" \"I'm a Squib,\" said Mrs. Figg. \"So you wouldn't have me registered, would you?\" \"A Squib, eh?\" said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. \"We'll be checking that. You'll leave details of your parentage with my assistant, Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?\" he added, looking left and right along the bench where he sat. \"Yes, we can!\" said Mrs. Figg indignantly. Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. \"Very well,\" he said coolly. \"What is your story?\" \"I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the evening of the second of August,\" gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, \"when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running —\" \"Running?\" said Madam Bones sharply. \"Dementors don't run, they glide.\" \"That's what I meant to say,\" said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. \"Gliding along the alley toward what looked like two boys.\" \"What did they look like?\" said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the monocle's edges disappeared into her flesh. \"Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny —\" \"No, no,\" said Madam Bones impatiently, \"the dementors . . . describe them.\" \"Oh,\" said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. \"They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.\" Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground, or the rotting smell of them, or that terrible, rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air . . . A dumpy wizard with a large black mustache in the second row leaned close to his neighbor, a frizzy-haired witch, and whispered something in her ear. She smirked and nodded. \"Big and wearing cloaks,\" repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. \"I see. Anything else?\" \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Figg. \"I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer's night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though all happiness had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . . dreadful things. . . .\" Her voice shook and died. Madam Bones' eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it. \"What did the dementors do?\" she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope. \"They went for the boys,\" said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. \"One of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced silver vapor. On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased away the second from his cousin. And that . . . that was what happened,\" Mrs. Figg finished, somewhat lamely. Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence; Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively \"That's what you saw, is it?\" \"That was what happened,\" Mrs. Figg repeated. \"Very well,\" said Fudge. \"You may go.\" Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off toward the door again. Harry heard it thud shut behind her. \"Not a very convincing witness,\" said Fudge loftily. \"Oh, I don't know,\" said Madam Bones in her booming voice. \"She certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately. And I can't imagine why she would say they were there if they weren't —\" \"But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard?\" snorted Fudge. \"The odds on that must be very, very long, even Bagman wouldn't have bet —\" \"Oh, I don't think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence,\" said Dumbledore lightly. The witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in shadow moved slightly, but everyone else was quite still and silent. \"And what is that supposed to mean?\" asked Fudge icily. \"It means that I think they were ordered there,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!\" barked Fudge. \"Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.\" \"Yes, you have,\" said Fudge forcefully, \"and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to.\" \"Then,\" said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, \"we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of August.\" In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forward so that Harry saw her for the first time. He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon, and a very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round, and slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue. \"The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,\" said Fudge. The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak. \"I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,\" she said with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. \"So silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!\" She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused. \"If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,\" said Dumbledore politely. \"Of course, these particular dementors may have been outside Ministry control —\" \"There are no dementors outside Ministry control!\" snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red. Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow. \"Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorization.\" \"It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore!\" snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would have been proud. \"Of course it isn't,\" said Dumbledore mildly. \"I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated.\" He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him, frowning slightly. \"I would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy's imagination, is not the subject of this hearing!\" said Fudge. \"We are here to examine Harry Potter's offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery!\" \"Of course we are,\" said Dumbledore, \"but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or Muggles present at the time of the —\" \"We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!\" snarled Fudge. \"Of course you are,\" said Dumbledore courteously. \"Then we are in agreement that Harry's use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes?\" \"If there were dementors, which I doubt —\" \"You have heard from an eyewitness,\" Dumbledore interrupted. \"If you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she would not object.\" \"I — that — not —\" blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him. \"It's — I want this over with today, Dumbledore!\" \"But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,\" said Dumbledore. \"Serious miscarriage, my hat!\" said Fudge at the top of his voice. \"Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you've forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years ago —\" \"That wasn't me, it was a house-elf!\" said Harry. \"YOU SEE?\" roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry's direction. \"A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you —\" \"The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,\" said Dumbledore. \"I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish.\" \"I — not — I haven't got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that's not the only — he blew up his aunt, for God's sake!\" Fudge shouted, banging his fist on the judge's bench and upsetting a bottle of ink. \"And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,\" said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes. \"And I haven't even started on what he gets up to at school —\" \"— but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school, Harry's behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry,\" said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words. \"Oho!\" said Fudge. \"Not our business what he does at school, eh? You think so?\" \"The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,\" said Dumbledore. \"Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.\" \"Laws can be changed,\" said Fudge savagely. \"Of course they can,\" said Dumbledore, inclining his head. \"And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!\" A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless. \"As far as I am aware, however,\" Dumbledore continued, \"there is no law yet in place that says this court's job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a specific offense and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do now is to await your verdict.\" Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more. Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry's attempt to catch his eye. He continued to look up at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, whispered conversations. Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had expected the hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that he had made a good impression. He had not really said very much. He ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed. . . . Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoes. Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining his laces. \"Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?\" said Madam Bones's booming voice. Harry's head jerked upward. There were hands in the air, many of them . . . more than half! Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but before he could finish Madam Bones had said, \"And those in favor of conviction?\" Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the witch on his right and the heavily mustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in the second row. Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He took two deep breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, \"Very well, very well . . . cleared of all charges.\" \"Excellent,\" said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling out his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. \"Well, I must be getting along. Good day to you all.\" And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon.\n",

      "Bill and Fleur's cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He could not remember, ever before, choosing not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together. \"What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?\" \"What if working out what the symbol meant made you 'worthy' to get the Hallows?\" \"Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-Who?\" Harry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to him. The odd thing was that Hermione's support made him feel just as confused as Ron's doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered. \"You could never have done that, Harry,\" she said again and again. \"You couldn't have broken into Dumbledore's grave.\" But the idea of Dumbledore's corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore's intentions. He felt that he was still groping in the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died. \"But is he dead?\" said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument. \"Yes, he is, Ron, please don't start that again!\" \"Look at the facts, Hermione,\" said Ron, speaking across Harry,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE who continued to gaze at the horizon. \"The silver doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror —\" \"Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don't you, Harry?\" \"I could have,\" said Harry without looking at her. \"But you don't think you did, do you?\" asked Ron. \"No, I don't,\" said Harry. \"There you go!\" said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. \"If it wasn't Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?\" \"I can't — but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he's lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?\" \"I dunno, it could've been his ghost!\" \"Dumbledore wouldn't come back as a ghost,\" said Harry. There was little about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that much. \"He would have gone on.\" \"What d'you mean, 'gone on'?\" asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice behind them said, \" 'Arry?\" Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze. \" 'Arry, Grip'ook would like to speak to you. 'E eez in ze smallest bedroom, 'e says 'e does not want to be over'eard.\" Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable as she walked back around the house. Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage's three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage. \"I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,\" said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. \"Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you —\" \"That's great!\" said Harry, relief surging through him. \"Griphook, thank you, we're really —\" \"— in return,\" said the goblin firmly, \"for payment.\" Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. \"How much do you want? I've got gold.\" \"Not gold,\" said Griphook. \"I have gold.\" His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. \"I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.\" Harry's spirits plummeted. \"You can't have that,\" he said. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Then,\" said the goblin softly, \"we have a problem.\" \"We can give you something else,\" said Ron eagerly. \"I'll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault.\" He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily. \"I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!\" \"The sword's ours —\" \"It is not,\" said the goblin. \"We're Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor's —\" \"And before it was Gryffindor's, whose was it?\" demanded the goblin, sitting up straight. \"No one's,\" said Ron. \"It was made for him, wasn't it?\" \"No!\" cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. \"Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was RagnukCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE the First's, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the goblins! The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!\" Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then said, \"We need to discuss this, Griphook, if that's all right. Could you give us a few minutes?\" The goblin nodded, looking sour. Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, \"He's having a laugh. We can't let him have that sword.\" \"It is true?\" Harry asked Hermione. \"Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?\" \"I don't know,\" she said hopelessly. \"Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there's no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.\" \"It'll be one of those goblin stories,\" said Ron, \"about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn't asked for one of our wands.\" \"Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"They've been treated brutally in the past.\" \"Goblins aren't exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?\" said Ron. \"They've killed plenty of us. They've fought dirty too.\" \"But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn't going to make him more likely to help us, is it?\" There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked out of the window at Dobby's grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone. \"Okay,\" said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, \"how's this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault, and then he can have it. There's a fake in there, isn't there? We switch them, and give him the fake.\" \"Ron, he'd know the difference better than we would!\" said Hermione. \"He's the only one who realized there had been a swap!\" \"Yeah, but we could scarper before he realizes —\" He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him. \"That,\" she said quietly, \"is despicable. Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you wonder why goblins don't like wizards, Ron?\" Ron's ears had turned red. \"All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What's your solution, then?\" \"We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.\" \"Brilliant. I'll go and get one of our other ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap it.\" Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him: He had always been proud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin. . . . \"Maybe he's lying,\" Harry said, opening his eyes again. \"Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor didn't take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history's right?\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE \"Does it make a difference?\" asked Hermione. \"Changes how I feel about it,\" said Harry. He took a deep breath. \"We'll tell him he can have the sword after he's helped us get into that vault — but we'll be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it.\" A grin spread slowly across Ron's face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed. \"Harry, we can't —\" \"He can have it,\" Harry went on, \"after we've used it on all of the Horcruxes. I'll make sure he gets it then. I'll keep my word.\" \"But that could be years!\" said Hermione. \"I know that, but he needn't. I won't be lying . . . really.\" Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard: For the Greater Good. He pushed the idea away. What choice did they have? \"I don't like it,\" said Hermione. \"Nor do I, much,\" Harry admitted. \"Well, I think it's genius,\" said Ron, standing up again. \"Let's go and tell him.\" Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry. \"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Then shake,\" said the goblin, holding out his hand. Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, \"So. We begin!\" It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They settled to work in the smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook's preference, in semidarkness. \"I have visited the Lestranges' vault only once,\" Griphook told them, \"on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected. . . .\" They remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time. Slowly the days stretched into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted. \"There's really only enough left for one of us,\" said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight. \"That'll be enough,\" said Harry, who was examining Griphook's hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways. The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill's eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned. The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures, and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizardsCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE to reach the Lestranges' vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it: They needed Griphook. The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi. Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work. \"I'm sorry,\" he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. \"I never meant you to have to deal with all of this.\" She had just set some knives to work, chopping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced away behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened. \" 'Arry, you saved my sister's life, I do not forget.\" This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had never been in real danger. \"Anyway,\" Fleur went on, pointing her wand at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to bubble at once, \"Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel's zis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze goblin,\" she scowled a little at the mention of him, \"can move downstairs, and you, Ron, and Dean can take zat room.\" \"We don't mind sleeping in the living room,\" said Harry, who knew that Griphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. \"Don't worry about us.\" And when she tried to protest he went on, \"We'll be off your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won't need to be here much longer.\" \"But what do you mean?\" she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair. \"Of course you must not leave, you are safe 'ere!\" She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door opened at that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood. \". . . and tiny little ears,\" Luna was saying, \"a bit like a hippo's, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast. . . .\" Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. Seizing the chance to escape Fleur's questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed them. \". . . and if you ever come to our house I'll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven't seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas,\" Luna was saying, as she and Dean relaid the fire. \"Luna, we told you,\" Hermione called over to her. \"That horn exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack —\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE \"No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,\" said Luna serenely. \"Daddy told me. It will probably have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know.\" Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. Ollivander down the stairs. The wand-maker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill's arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase. \"I'm going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,\" said Luna, approaching the old man. \"And I you, my dear,\" said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. \"You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.\" \"So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,\" said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. \"And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill's Auntie Muriel? I never returned 'er tiara.\" \"It will be an honor,\" said Ollivander with a little bow, \"the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.\" Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. \"Moonstones and diamonds,\" said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry noticing. \"Made by goblins, I think?\" \"And paid for by wizards,\" said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging. A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander set off into the night. The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely playing with her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; however, Bill returned before they had finished their first course, his long hair tangled by the wind. \"Everything's fine,\" he told Fleur. \"Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her love. Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they're still operating an Owl-Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she thought we'd stolen it.\" \"Ah, she eez charmante, your aunt,\" said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them and marched out of the room. \"Daddy's made a tiara,\" piped up Luna. \"Well, more of a crown, really.\" Ron caught Harry's eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius. \"Yes, he's trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he's identified most of the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference —\" There was a bang on the front door. Everyone's head turned toward it. Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feet, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight. \"Who is it?\" Bill called. \"It is I, Remus John Lupin!\" called a voice over the howling wind. Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? \"I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE \"Lupin,\" muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling cloak, his graying hair windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried aloud, \"It's a boy! We've named him Ted, after Dora's father!\" Hermione shrieked. \"Wha — ? Tonks — Tonks has had the baby?\" \"Yes, yes, she's had the baby!\" shouted Lupin. All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both squealed, \"Congratulations!\" and Ron said, \"Blimey, a baby!\" as if he had never heard of such a thing before. \"Yes — yes — a boy,\" said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He strode around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never have happened. \"You'll be godfather?\" he said as he released Harry. \"M-me?\" stammered Harry \"You, yes, of course — Dora quite agrees, no one better —\" \"I — yeah — blimey —\" Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink. \"I can't stay long, I must get back,\" said Lupin, beaming around at them all: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him. \"Thank you, thank you, Bill.\" Bill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high in a toast. \"To Teddy Remus Lupin,\" said Lupin, \"a great wizard in the making!\" \" 'Oo does 'e look like?\" Fleur inquired. \"I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it's turned ginger in the hour since. Probably be blond by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks's hair started changing color the day that she was born.\" He drained his goblet. \"Oh, go on then, just one more,\" he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again. The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Lupin's news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill's eyes following the goblin up the stairs. \"No . . . no . . . I really must get back,\" said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself. \"Good-bye, good-bye — I'll try and bring some pictures in a few days' time — they'll all be so glad to know that I've seen you —\" He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night. \"Godfather, Harry!\" said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the table. \"A real honor! Congratulations!\" As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE the door behind him closed, shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin's absence. \"I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn't been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.\" Bill hesitated. \"Harry, you're planning something with Griphook.\" It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting. \"I know goblins,\" said Bill. \"I've worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends — or, at least, goblins I know well, and like.\" Again, Bill hesitated. \"Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return?\" \"I can't tell you that,\" said Harry. \"Sorry, Bill.\" The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets. \"Wait,\" Bill told her. \"Just a moment.\" She backed out and he closed the door again. \"Then I have to say this,\" Bill went on. \"If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones.\" Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. \"We are talking about a different breed of being,\" said Bill. \"Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries — but you'll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership.\" \"I respect —\" Harry began, but Bill shook his head. \"You don't understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin-made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.\" \"But if it was bought —\" \"— then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, however, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook's face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than theft.\" Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was letting on. \"All I am saying,\" said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, \"is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE \"Right,\" said Harry as Bill opened the door, \"yeah. Thanks. I'll bear that in mind.\" As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him.\n",

      "Hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione's bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face. Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term started, they brought her each day's homework. \"If I'd sprouted whiskers, I'd take a break from work,\" said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione's bedside table one evening. \"Don't be silly, Ron, I've got to keep up,\" said Hermione briskly. Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had  gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. \"I don't suppose you've got any new leads?\" she added in a whisper, so that Madam Pomfrey couldn't hear her. \"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily. \"I was so sure it was Malfoy,\" said Ron, for about the hundredth time. \"What's that?\" asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione's pillow. \"Just a get well card,\" said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud: \"To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award.\" Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted. \"You sleep with this under your pillow?\" But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine. \"Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you've ever met, or what?\" Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so much homework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a Hair-Raising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears. \"That's Filch,\" Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard. \"You don't think someone else's been attacked?\" said Ron tensely. They stood still, their heads inclined toward Filch's voice, which sounded quite hysterical. \"— even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven't got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I'm going to Dumbledore —\" His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam. They poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle's wails echoing off the bathroom walls. \"Now what's up with her?\" said Ron. \"Let's go and see,\" said Harry, and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its out of order sign, ignored it as always, and entered. Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet. \"What's up, Myrtle?\" said Harry. \"Who's that?\" glugged Myrtle miserably. \"Come to throw something else at me?\" Harry waded across to her stall and said, \"Why would I throw something at you?\" \"Don't ask me,\" Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. \"Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me. . . .\" \"But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you,\" said Harry, reasonably. \"I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?\" He had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, \"Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don't think!\" \"Who threw it at you, anyway?\" asked Harry. \"I don't know. . . . I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,\" said Myrtle, glaring at them. \"It's over there, it got washed out. . . .\" Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back. \"What?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy?\" said Ron. \"It could be dangerous.\" \"Dangerous?\" said Harry, laughing. \"Come off it, how could it be dangerous?\" \"You'd be surprised,\" said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at the book. \"Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated — Dad's told me — there was one that burned your eyes out. And  everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed. And —\" \"All right, I've got the point,\" said Harry. The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy. \"Well, we won't find out unless we look at it,\" he said, and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the floor. Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page he could just make out the name \"T. M. Riddle\" in smudged ink. \"Hang on,\" said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry's shoulder. \"I know that name. . . . T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.\" \"How on earth d'you know that?\" said Harry in amazement. \"Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention,\" said Ron resentfully. \"That was the one I burped slugs all over. If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it, too.\" Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank. There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel's birthday, or dentist, half-past three. \"He never wrote in it,\" said Harry, disappointed. \"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\" said Ron curiously. Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London. \"He must've been Muggle-born,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road. . . .\" \"Well, it's not much use to you,\" said Ron. He dropped his voice. \"Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle's nose.\" Harry, however, pocketed it. Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and fur-free, at the beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle's diary and told her the story of how they had found it. \"Oooh, it might have hidden powers,\" said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely. \"If it has, it's hiding them very well,\" said Ron. \"Maybe it's shy. I don't know why you don't chuck it, Harry.\" \"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\" said Harry. \"I wouldn't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.\" \"Could've been anything,\" said Ron. \"Maybe he got thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would've done everyone a favor. . . .\" But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione's face that she was thinking what he was thinking. \"What?\" said Ron, looking from one to the other. \"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't it?\" he said. \"That's what Malfoy said.\" \"Yeah . . .\" said Ron slowly. \"And this diary is fifty years old,\" said Hermione, tapping it excitedly. \"So?\" \"Oh, Ron, wake up,\" snapped Hermione. \"We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything — where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it — the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying around, would they?\" \"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in his diary.\" But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag. \"It might be invisible ink!\" she whispered. She tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium!\" Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser. \"It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\" she said. She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened. \"I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in.\" Harry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throw Riddle's diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though  Riddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and had half-forgotten. But this was absurd. He'd never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that. Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle's special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he'd seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime. Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It didn't carry details of why it had been given to him (\"Good thing, too, or it'd be even bigger and I'd still be polishing it,\" said Ron). However, they did find Riddle's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys. \"He sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \"Prefect, Head Boy . . . probably top of every class —\" \"You say that like it's a bad thing,\" said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice. The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood. \"The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,\" Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.\" Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years. . . . Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \"given himself away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn't helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, you rotter . . .\" now with a dance routine to match. Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration. \"I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Minerva,\" he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. \"I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him. \"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won't say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing. . . .\" He tapped his nose again and strode off. Lockhart's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he'd walked through the wrong doors. The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles. \"What's going on?\" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon. Ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro. \"Happy Valentine's Day!\" Lockhart shouted. \"And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all — and it doesn't end here!\" Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps. \"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\" beamed Lockhart. \"They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog!\" Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison. \"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six,\" said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn't answer. All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry. \"Oy, you! 'Arry Potter!\" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry. Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces. \"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person,\" he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way. \"Not here,\" Harry hissed, trying to escape. \"Stay still !\" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry's bag and pulling him back. \"Let me go!\" Harry snarled, tugging. With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything. Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor. \"What's going on here?\" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine. \"What's all this commotion?\" said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived. Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor. \"Right,\" he said, sitting on Harry's ankles. \"Here is your singing valentine: His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, His hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he was mine, he's really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord.\" Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth. \"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \"And you, Malfoy —\" Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he'd got Riddle's diary. \"Give that back,\" said Harry quietly. \"Wonder what Potter's written in this?\" said Malfoy, who obvi- ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified. \"Hand it over, Malfoy,\" said Percy sternly. \"When I've had a look,\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry. Percy said, \"As a school prefect —\" but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it. \"Harry!\" said Percy loudly. \"No magic in the corridors. I'll have to report this, you know!\" But Harry didn't care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, \"I don't think Potter liked your valentine much!\" Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn't need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs. It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle's diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn't much interested in anything else. Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George singing, \"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\" one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time. Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary. The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, \"My name is Harry Potter.\" The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened. Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written. \"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?\" These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back. \"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.\" He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply. \"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read.\" \"What do you mean?\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement. \"I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\" \"That's where I am now,\" Harry wrote quickly. \"I'm at Hog-warts, and horrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?\" His heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew. \"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person who'd opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned.\" Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back. \"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time?\" \"I can show you, if you like,\" came Riddle's reply. \"You don't have to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him.\" Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming. \"Let me show you.\" Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters. \"OK.\" The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a minuscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow. He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus. He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office — but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before. \"I'm sorry,\" he said shakily. \"I didn't mean to butt in —\" But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \"Er — I'll just go, shall I?\" Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice. \"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now,\" he half-shouted. The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window. The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door. Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix — no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago. There was a knock on the office door. \"Enter,\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice. A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair. \"Ah, Riddle,\" said the headmaster. \"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\" said Riddle. He looked nervous. \"Sit down,\" said Dippet. \"I've just been reading the letter you sent me.\" \"Oh,\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly. \"My dear boy,\" said Dippet kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\" \"No,\" said Riddle at once. \"I'd much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that — to that —\" \"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\" said Dippet curiously. \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle, reddening slightly. \"You are Muggle-born?\" \"Half-blood, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother.\" \"And are both your parents — ?\" \"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me — Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\" Dippet clucked his tongue sympathetically. \"The thing is, Tom,\" he sighed, \"special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances. . . .\" \"You mean all these attacks, sir?\" said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything. \"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy . . . the death of that poor little girl. . . . You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the — er — source of all this unpleasantness. . . .\" Riddle's eyes had widened. \"Sir — if the person was caught — if it all stopped —\" \"What do you mean?\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\" \"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly. But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that he himself had given Dumbledore. Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed. \"You may go, Tom. . . .\" Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him. Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed. Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn't see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase. \"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?\" Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-yearyounger Dumbledore. \"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since . . .\" He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit. But to Harry's disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn't been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside. It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door. Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn't be heard. For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper. \"C'mon . . . gotta get yeh outta here. . . . C'mon now . . . in the box . . .\" There was something familiar about that voice. . . . Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it. \" 'Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply. The boy slammed the door shut and stood up. \"What yer doin' down here, Tom?\" Riddle stepped closer. \"It's all over,\" he said. \"I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop.\" \"What d'yeh —\" \"I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and —\" \"It never killed no one!\" said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking. \"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered. . . .\" \"It wasn't him!\" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. \"He wouldn'! He never!\" \"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out his wand. His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone — A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers — Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, \"NOOOOOOO!\" The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach. Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in. \"There you are,\" he said. Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking. \"What's up?\" said Ron, looking at him with concern. \"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.\"\n",

      "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\" Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing . . .\" Dudley's birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he  wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\" Don't ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put  together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\" Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty . . . thirty . . .\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction. Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. \"What about what's-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \". . . and leave him in the car. . . .\" \"That cars new, he's not sitting in it alone. . . .\" Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying — it had been years since he'd really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I . . . don't . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly . . .\" But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \". . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don't,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" The snake nodded vigorously. \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see — so you've never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He  couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n",

      "Harry sprinted up to the boys' dormitory to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map from his trunk; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls' dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats. \"Well, it's cold out there!\" she said defensively, as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently. They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the cloak — Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing — then, moving slowly and cautiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Norris. They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like \"Weasley Is Our King.\" They crept across the entrance hall and then out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid's chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind him, and they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door; when Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside. \"Hagrid, it's us!\" Harry called through the keyhole. \"Shoulda known!\" said a gruff voice. They beamed at one another under the cloak; they could tell that Hagrid's voice was pleased. \"Bin home three seconds . . . Out the way, Fang . . . Out the way, yeh dozy dog . . .\" The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open, and Hagrid's head appeared in the gap. Hermione screamed. \"Merlin's beard, keep it down!\" said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. \"Under that cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!\" \"I'm sorry!\" Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them. \"I just — oh, Hagrid !\" \"It's nuthin', it's nuthin'!\" said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror. Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood, and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple-and-black bruises. There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleeding, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home; a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man and three times as broad, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it. \"What happened to you?\" Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick their faces. \"Told yeh, nuthin',\" said Hagrid firmly. \"Want a cuppa?\" \"Come off it,\" said Ron, \"you're in a right state!\" \"I'm tellin' yeh, I'm fine,\" said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing. \"Blimey, it's good ter see you three again — had good summers, did yeh?\" \"Hagrid, you've been attacked!\" said Ron. \"Fer the las' time, it's nuthin'!\" said Hagrid firmly. \"Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?\" Ron demanded. \"You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,\" said Hermione anxiously. \"Some of those cuts look nasty.\" \"I'm dealin' with it, all righ'?\" said Hagrid repressively. He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire. \"You're not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?\" said Ron, leaning in for a closer look. \"It looks poisonous.\" \"It's s'posed ter look like that, it's dragon meat,\" Hagrid said. \"An' I didn' get it ter eat.\" He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face. Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction. \"Tha's better. It helps with the stingin', yeh know.\" \"So are you going to tell us what's happened to you?\" Harry asked. \"Can', Harry. Top secret. More'n me job's worth ter tell yeh that.\" \"Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione quietly. Hagrid's fingers slipped on the dragon steak, and it slid squelchily onto his chest. \"Giants?\" said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face. \"Who said anythin' abou' giants?  Who yeh bin talkin' to? Who's told yeh what I've — who's said I've bin — eh?\" \"We guessed,\" said Hermione apologetically. \"Oh, yeh did, did yeh?\" said Hagrid, fixing her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak. \"It was kind of . . . obvious,\" said Ron. Harry nodded. Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak onto the table again and strode back to the kettle, which was now whistling. \"Never known kids like you three fer knowin' more'n yeh oughta,\" he muttered, splashing boiling water into three of his bucket-shaped mugs. \"An' I'm not complimentin' yeh, neither. Nosy, some'd call it. Interferin'.\" But his beard twitched. \"So you have been to look for giants?\" said Harry, grinning as he sat down at the table. Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his steak again, and slapped it back over his face. \"Yeah, all righ',\" he grunted, \"I have.\" \"And you found them?\" said Hermione in a hushed voice. \"Well, they're not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,\" said Hagrid. \"Pretty big, see.\" \"Where are they?\" said Ron. \"Mountains,\" said Hagrid unhelpfully. \"So why don't Muggles — ?\" \"They do,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"O'ny their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin' accidents, aren' they?\" He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising. \"Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you've been up to!\" said Ron. \"Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors —\" Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea, and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft splat, onto the floor. \"Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?\" growled Hagrid. \"Didn't you know?\" Hermione asked him, wide-eyed. \"I don' know anything that's been happenin' since I left. I was on a secret mission, wasn' I, didn' wan' owls followin' me all over the place — ruddy dementors! Yeh're not serious?\" \"Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me —\" \"WHAT?\" \"— and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first.\" \"You were expelled?\" \"Tell us about your summer and I'll tell you about mine.\" Hagrid glared at him through his one open eye. Harry looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on his face. \"Oh, all righ',\" Hagrid said in a resigned voice. He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang's mouth. \"Oh, Hagrid, don't, it's not hygien —\" Hermione began, but Ha-grid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye. He took another fortifying gulp of tea and then said, \"Well, we set off righ' after term ended —\" \"Madame Maxime went with you, then?\" Hermione interjected. \"Yeah, tha's right,\" said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak. \"Yeah, it was jus' the pair of us. An' I'll tell yeh this, she's not afraid of roughin' it, Olympe. Yeh know, she's a fine, well-dressed woman, an' knowin' where we was goin' I wondered 'ow she'd feel abou' clamberin' over boulders an' sleepin' in caves an' tha', bu' she never complained once.\" \"You knew where you were going?\" Harry asked. \"You knew where the giants were?\" \"Well, Dumbledore knew, an' he told us,\" said Hagrid. \"Are they hidden?\" asked Ron. \"Is it a secret, where they are?\" \"Not really,\" said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head. \"It's jus' that mos' wizards aren' bothered where they are, s' long as it's a good long way away. But where they are's very difficult ter get ter, fer humans anyway, so we needed Dumbledore's instructions. Took us abou' a month ter get there —\" \"A month?\" said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time. \"But — why couldn't you just grab a Portkey or something?\" There was an odd expression in Hagrid's unobscured eye as he squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying. \"We're bein' watched, Ron,\" he said gruffly. \"What d'you mean?\" \"Yeh don' understand,\" said Hagrid. \"The Ministry's keepin' an eye on Dumbledore an' anyone they reckon's in league with him, an' —\" \"We know about that,\" said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest of Hagrid's story. \"We know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore —\" \"So you couldn't use magic to get there?\" asked Ron, looking thunderstruck. \"You had to act like Muggles all the way?\" \"Well, not exactly all the way,\" said Hagrid cagily. \"We jus' had ter be careful, 'cause Olympe an' me, we stick out a bit —\" Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea. \"— so we're not hard ter follow. We was pretendin' we was goin' on holiday together, so we got inter France an' we made like we was headin' fer where Olympe's school is, 'cause we knew we was bein' tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, 'cause I'm not really s'posed ter use magic an' we knew the Ministry'd be lookin' fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin' us the slip round abou' Dee-John —\" \"Ooooh, Dijon?\" said Hermione excitedly. \"I've been there on holiday, did you see — ?\" She fell silent at the look on Ron's face. \"We chanced a bit o' magic after that, and it wasn' a bad journey. Ran inter a couple o' mad trolls on the Polish border, an' I had a sligh' disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha', couldn't'a bin smoother. \"An' then we reached the place, an' we started trekkin' up through the mountains, lookin' fer signs of 'em . . . \"We had ter lay off the magic once we got near 'em. Partly 'cause they don' like wizards an' we didn' want ter put their backs up too soon, and partly 'cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an' all. Said it was odds on he'd sent a messenger off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin' attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.\" Hagrid paused for a long draft of tea. \"Go on!\" said Harry urgently. \"Found 'em,\" said Hagrid baldly. \"Went over a ridge one nigh' an' there they was, spread ou' underneath us. Little fires burnin' below an' huge shadows . . . It was like watchin' bits o' the mountain movin'.\" \"How big are they?\" asked Ron in a hushed voice. \" 'Bout twenty feet,\" said Hagrid casually. \"Some o' the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.\" \"And how many were there?\" asked Harry. \"I reckon abou' seventy or eighty,\" said Hagrid. \"Is that all?\" said Hermione. \"Yep,\" said Hagrid sadly, \"eighty left, an' there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff'rent tribes from all over the world. But they've bin dyin' out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o' course, but  mostly they killed each other, an' now they're dyin' out faster than ever. They're not made ter live bunched up together like tha'. Dumbledore says it's our fault, it was the wizards who forced 'em to go an' made 'em live a good long way from us an' they had no choice but ter stick together fer their own protection.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"you saw them and then what?\" \"Well, we waited till morning, didn' want ter go sneakin' up on 'em in the dark, fer our own safety,\" said Hagrid. \" 'Bout three in the mornin' they fell asleep jus' where they was sittin'. We didn' dare sleep. Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of 'em woke up an' came up where we were, an' fer another, the snorin' was unbelievable. Caused an avalanche near mornin'. \"Anyway, once it was light we wen' down ter see 'em.\" \"Just like that?\" said Ron, looking awestruck. \"You just walked right into a giant camp?\" \"Well, Dumbledore'd told us how ter do it,\" said Hagrid. \"Give the Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.\" \"Give the what gifts?\" asked Harry. \"Oh, the Gurg — means the chief.\" \"How could you tell which one was the Gurg?\" asked Ron. Hagrid grunted in amusement. \"No problem,\" he said. \"He was the biggest, the ugliest, an' the laziest. Sittin' there waitin' ter be brought food by the others. Dead goats an' such like. Name o' Karkus. I'd put him at twenty-two, twenty-three feet, an' the weight of a couple o' bull elephants. Skin like rhino hide an' all.\" \"And you just walked up to him?\" said Hermione breathlessly. \"Well . . . down ter him, where he was lyin' in the valley. They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an' Karkus was lyin' by the lake roarin' at the others ter feed him an' his wife. Olympe an' I went down the mountainside —\" \"But didn't they try and kill you when they saw you?\" asked Ron incredulously. \"It was def'nitely on some of their minds,\" said Hagrid, shrugging, \"but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an' keep our eyes on the Gurg an' ignore the others. So tha's what we did. An' the rest of 'em went quiet an' watched us pass an' we got right up ter Karkus's feet an' we bowed an' put our present down in front o' him.\" \"What do you give a giant?\" asked Ron eagerly. \"Food?\" \"Nah, he can get food all righ' fer himself,\" said Hagrid. \"We took him magic. Giants like magic, jus' don't like us usin' it against 'em. Anyway, that firs' day we gave him a branch o' Gubraithian fire.\" Hermione said \"wow\" softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement. \"A branch of — ?\" \"Everlasting fire,\" said Hermione irritably, \"you ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick's mentioned it at least twice in class!\" \"Well anyway,\" said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, \"Dumbledore'd bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn' somethin' any wizard could do, an' so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus's feet and says, 'A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.' \" \"And what did Karkus say?\" asked Harry eagerly. \"Nothin',\" said Hagrid. \"Didn' speak English.\" \"You're kidding!\" \"Didn' matter,\" said Hagrid imperturbably, \"Dumbledore had warned us tha' migh' happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o' giants who knew our lingo an' they translated fer us.\" \"And did he like the present?\" asked Ron. \"Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,\" said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye. \"Very pleased. So then I said, 'Albus Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift.' \" \"Why couldn't you speak to them that day?\" asked Hermione. \"Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,\" said Hagrid. \"Let 'em see we kept our promises. We'll come back tomorrow with another present, an' then we do come back with another present — gives a good impression, see? An' gives them time ter test out the firs' present an' find out it's a good one, an' get 'em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus — overload 'em with information an' they'll kill yeh jus' to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an' went off an' found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in, an' the followin' mornin' we went back an' this time we found Karkus sittin' up waitin' fer us lookin' all eager.\" \"And you talked to him?\" \"Oh yeah. Firs' we presented him with a nice battle helmet — goblin-made an' indestructible, yeh know — an' then we sat down an' we talked.\" \"What did he say?\" \"Not much,\" said Hagrid. \"Listened mostly. But there were good signs. He'd heard o' Dumbledore, heard he'd argued against the killin' of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int'rested in what Dumbledore had ter say. An' a few o' the others, 'specially the ones who had some English, they gathered round an' listened too. We were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next day with another present. \"But that night it all wen' wrong.\" \"What d'you mean?\" said Ron quickly. \"Well, like I say, they're not meant ter live together, giants,\" said Hagrid sadly. \"Not in big groups like that. They can' help themselves, they half kill each other every few weeks. The men fight each other an'  the women fight each other, the remnants of the old tribes fight each other, an' that's even without squabbles over food an' the best fires an' sleepin' spots. Yeh'd think, seein' as how their whole race is abou' finished, they'd lay off each other, but . . .\" Hagrid sighed deeply \"That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin' down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn' believe the noise. An' when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an' his head was lyin' at the bottom o' the lake.\" \"Whose head?\" gasped Hermione. \"Karkus's,\" said Hagrid heavily. \"There was a new Gurg, Golgomath.\" He sighed deeply. \"Well, we hadn' bargained on a new Gurg two days after we'd made friendly contact with the firs' one, an' we had a funny feelin' Golgomath wouldn' be so keen ter listen to us, but we had ter try.\" \"You went to speak to him?\" asked Ron incredulously. \"After you'd watched him rip off another giant's head?\" \" 'Course we did,\" said Hagrid, \"we hadn' gone all that way ter give up after two days! We wen' down with the next present we'd meant ter give ter Karkus. \"I knew it was no go before I'd opened me mouth. He was sitting there wearin' Karkus's helmet, leerin' at us as we got nearer. He's massive, one o' the biggest ones there. Black hair an' matchin' teeth an' a necklace o' bones. Human-lookin' bones, some of 'em. Well, I gave it a go — held out a great roll o' dragon skin — an' said A gift fer the Gurg of the giants —' Nex' thing I knew, I was hangin' upside down in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me.\" Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth. \"How did you get out of that?\" asked Harry. \"Wouldn'ta done if Olympe hadn' bin there,\" said Hagrid. \"She pulled out her wand an' did some o' the fastes' spellwork I've ever seen. Ruddy marvelous. Hit the two holdin' me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an' they dropped me straightaway — bu' we were in trouble then, 'cause we'd used magic against 'em, an' that's what giants hate abou' wizards. We had ter leg it an' we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again.\" \"Blimey, Hagrid,\" said Ron quietly. \"So how come it's taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?\" asked Hermione. \"We didn' leave after three days!\" said Hagrid, looking outraged. \"Dumbledore was relyin' on us!\" \"But you've just said there was no way you could go back!\" \"Not by daylight, we couldn', no. We just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o' days lyin' low up in the cave an' watchin'. An' wha' we saw wasn' good.\" \"Did he rip off more heads?\" asked Hermione, sounding squeamish. \"No,\" said Hagrid. \"I wish he had.\" \"What d'you mean?\" \"I mean we soon found out he didn' object ter all wizards — just us.\" \"Death Eaters?\" said Harry quickly. \"Yep,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"Couple of 'em were visitin' him ev'ry day, bringin' gifts ter the Gurg, an' he wasn' dangling them upside down.\" \"How d'you know they were Death Eaters?\" said Ron. \"Because I recognized one of 'em,\" Hagrid growled. \"Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes killin' as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin' on so well.\" \"So Macnair's persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?\" said Hermione desperately. \"Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven' finished me story yet!\" said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. \"Me  an' Olympe talked it over an' we agreed, jus' 'cause the Gurg looked like favorin' You-Know-Who didn' mean all of 'em would. We had ter try an' persuade some o' the others, the ones who hadn' wanted Golgomath as Gurg.\" \"How could you tell which ones they were?\" asked Ron. \"Well, they were the ones bein' beaten to a pulp, weren' they?\" said Hagrid patiently. \"The ones with any sense were keepin' outta Golgomath's way, hidin' out in caves roun' the gully jus' like we were. So we decided we'd go pokin' round the caves by night an' see if we couldn' persuade a few o' them.\" \"You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?\" said Ron with awed respect in his voice. \"Well, it wasn' the giants who worried us most,\" said Hagrid. \"We were more concerned abou' the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us before we wen' not ter tangle with 'em if we could avoid it, an' the trouble was they knew we was around — 'spect Golgomath told him abou' us. At night when the giants were sleepin' an' we wanted ter be creepin' inter the caves, Macnair an' the other one were sneakin' round the mountains lookin' fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin' out at them,\" said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard. \"She was rarin' ter attack 'em. . . . she's somethin' when she's roused, Olympe. . . . Fiery, yeh know . . . 'spect it's the French in her . . .\" Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty seconds' reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly. \"So what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?\" \"What? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin' in and headed back down inter the gully, keepin' our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o' the caves, no go — then, in abou' the sixth one, we found three giants hidin'.\" \"Cave must've been cramped,\" said Ron. \"Wasn' room ter swing a kneazle,\" said Hagrid. \"Didn't they attack you when they saw you?\" asked Hermione. \"Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,\" said Ha-grid, \"but they was badly hurt, all three o' them. Golgomath's lot had beaten 'em unconscious; they'd woken up an' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o' them had a bit of English an' 'e translated fer the others, an' what we had ter say didn' seem ter go down too badly. So we kep' goin' back, visitin' the wounded. . . . I reckon we had abou' six or seven o' them convinced at one poin'.\" \"Six or seven?\" said Ron eagerly. \"Well that's not bad — are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?\" But Hermione said, \"What do you mean 'at one point,' Hagrid?\" Hagrid looked at her sadly. \"Golgomath's lot raided the caves. The ones tha' survived didn' wan' no more ter to do with us after that.\" \"So . . . so there aren't any giants coming?\" said Ron, looking disappointed. \"Nope,\" said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak again and applied the cooler side to his face, \"but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave 'em Dumbledore's message an' some o' them heard it an' I 'spect some o' them'll remember it. Jus' maybe, them that don' want ter stay around Golgomath'll move outta the mountains, an' there's gotta be a chance they'll remember Dumbledore's friendly to 'em. . . . Could be they'll come . . .\" Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap. \"Hagrid?\" said Hermione quietly after a while. \"Mmm?\" \"Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything about your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?\" Hagrid's unobscured eye rested upon her, and Hermione looked rather scared. \"I'm sorry . . . I . . . forget it —\" \"Dead,\" Hagrid grunted. \"Died years ago. They told me.\" \"Oh . . . I'm . . . I'm really sorry,\" said Hermione in a very small voice. Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. \"No need,\" he said shortly. \"Can' remember her much. Wasn' a great mother.\" They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak. \"But you still haven't explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,\" Ron said, gesturing toward Hagrid's bloodstained face. \"Or why you're back so late,\" said Harry. \"Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago —\" \"Who attacked you?\" said Ron. \"I haven' bin attacked!\" said Hagrid emphatically. \"I —\" But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain. \"It's her!\" Ron whispered. \"Get under here!\" Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived beneath the cloak as well. Huddled together they backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Ha-grid looked thoroughly confused. \"Hagrid, hide our mugs!\" Hagrid seized Harry's and Ron's mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang's basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open. Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to see Hagrid's face; she barely reached his navel. \"So,\" she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. \"You're Hagrid, are you?\" Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her bulging eyes rolling in every direction. \"Get away,\" she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face. \"Er — I don' want ter be rude,\" said Hagrid, staring at her, \"but who the ruddy hell are you?\" \"My name is Dolores Umbridge.\" Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione. \"Dolores Umbridge?\" Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. \"I thought you were one o' them Ministry — don' you work with Fudge?\" \"I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,\" said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak. \"I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher —\" \"Tha's brave of yeh,\" said Hagrid, \"there's not many'd take tha' job anymore —\" \"— and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,\" said Umbridge, giving no sign that she had heard him. \"Wha's that?\" said Hagrid, frowning. \"Precisely what I was going to ask,\" said Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione's mug. \"Oh,\" said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood hidden, \"oh, tha' was . . . was Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.\" Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabin's. \"I heard voices,\" she said quietly. \"I was talkin' ter Fang,\" said Hagrid stoutly. \"And was he talking back to you?\" \"Well . . . in a manner o' speakin',\" said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable. \"I sometimes say Fang's near enough human —\" \"There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,\" said Umbridge sleekly. Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth. Luckily, Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge's robes, and she did not appear to have heard. \"Well, I on'y jus' got back,\" said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack. \"Maybe someone came ter call earlier an' I missed em. \"There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.\" \"Well I . . . I don' know why that'd be. . . .\" said Hagrid, tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood, as though asking for help. \"Erm . . .\" Umbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin, looking around carefully. She bent and peered under the bed. She opened Hagrid's cupboards. She passed within two inches of where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled around again and said, \"What has happened to you? How did you sustain those injuries?\" Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in Harry's opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising  all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. \"Oh, I . . . had a bit of an accident,\" he said lamely. \"What sort of accident?\" \"I-I tripped.\" \"You tripped,\" she repeated coolly. \"Yeah, tha's right. Over . . . over a friends broomstick. I don' fly, meself. Well, look at the size o' me, I don' reckon there's a broomstick that'd hold me. Friend o' mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if you've ever seen 'em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, I've had a bit of a ride on one o' them an' it was —\" \"Where have you been?\" asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through Hagrid's babbling. \"Where've I . . . ?\" \"Been, yes,\" she said. \"Term started more than two months ago. Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You left no address. Where have you been?\" There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye. Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously. \"I — I've been away for me health,\" he said. \"For your health,\" said Umbridge. Her eyes traveled over Hagrid's discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto his waistcoat in the silence. \"I see.\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"bit o' — o' fresh air, yeh know —\" \"Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,\" said Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid's face that was not black or purple flushed. \"Well — change o' scene, yeh know —\" \"Mountain scenery?\" said Umbridge swiftly. She knows, Harry thought desperately. \"Mountains?\" Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. \"Nope, South of France fer me. Bit o' sun an' . . . an' sea.\" \"Really?\" said Umbridge. \"You don't have much of a tan.\" \"Yeah . . . well . . . sensitive skin,\" said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out. Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered. Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, \"I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.\" \"Righ',\" said Hagrid, nodding. \"You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough.\" She turned sharply and marched back to the door. \"You're inspectin' us?\" Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after her. \"Oh yes,\" said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle. \"The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Good night.\" She left, closing the door behind her with a snap. Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist. \"Not yet,\" she breathed in his ear. \"She might not be gone yet.\" Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so. \"She's goin' back ter the castle,\" he said in a low voice. \"Blimey . . . inspectin' people, is she?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, pulling the cloak off. \"Trelawney's on probation already. . . .\" \"Um . . . what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione. \"Oh, don' you worry abou' that, I've got a great load o' lessons planned,\" said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again. \"I've bin keepin' a couple o' creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they're some-thin' really special.\" \"Erm . . . special in what way?\" asked Hermione tentatively. \"I'm not sayin',\" said Hagrid happily. \"I don' want ter spoil the surprise.\" \"Look, Hagrid,\" said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense, \"Professor Umbridge won't be at all happy if you bring anything to class that's too dangerous —\" \"Dangerous?\" said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. \"Don' be silly, I wouldn' give yeh anythin' dangerous! I mean, all righ', they can look after themselves —\" \"Hagrid, you've got to pass Umbridge's inspection, and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like that!\" said Hermione earnestly. \"But tha's not very interestin', Hermione,\" said Hagrid. \"The stuff I've got's much more impressive, I've bin bringin' 'em on fer years, I reckon I've got the on'y domestic herd in Britain —\" \"Hagrid . . . please . . .\" said Hermione, a note of real desperation in her voice. \"Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull that's bound to come up in our O.W.L. . . .\" But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing toward the vast bed in the corner. \"Lis'en, it's bin a long day an' it's late,\" he said, patting Hermione gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud. \"Oh — sorry —\" He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes. \"Look, don' you go worryin' abou' me, I promise yeh I've got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I'm back. . . . Now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an' don' forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!\" \"I dunno if you got through to him,\" said Ron a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went. \"Then I'll go back again tomorrow,\" said Hermione determinedly. \"I'll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don't care if she throws out Trelawney but she's not taking Hagrid!\"\n",

      "They had expected to have to comb Hermione's Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Um-bridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline: MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER \"HIGH INQUISITOR\" \" 'High Inquisitor'?\" said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast slipping from his fingers. \"What does that mean?\" Hermione read aloud: \"In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \"'The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts for some time,' said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. 'He is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve.' \"This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person. \"'That's how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,' said Weasley last night. 'Dumbledore couldn't find anyone, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she's been an immediate success —' \" \"She's been a WHAT?\" said Harry loudly. \"Wait, there's more,\" said Hermione grimly. \" '— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-theground feedback about what's really happening at Hogwarts.' \"It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new position of 'Hogwarts High Inquisitor.' \"'This is an exciting new phase in the Minister's plan to get to grips with what some are calling the \"falling standards\" at Hogwarts,' said Weasley. 'The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post, and we are delighted to say that she has accepted.' \"The Ministry's new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts. \"'I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,' said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. 'Many of us with our children's best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore's eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.' \"Among those 'eccentric decisions' are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional ex-Auror 'Mad-Eye' Moody. \"Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts. \"'I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,' said a Ministry insider last night. \"Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts. \"'Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge's office,' said Madam Marchbanks. 'This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Al-bus Dumbledore.' (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks' alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17).\" Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two. \"So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed this 'Educational Decree' and forced her on us! And now he's given her the power to inspect other teachers!\" Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright. \"I can't believe this. It's outrageous. . . .\" \"I know it is,\" said Harry. He looked down at his right hand, clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin. But a grin was unfurling on Ron's face. \"What?\" said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him. \"Oh, I can't wait to see McGonagall inspected,\" said Ron happily. \"Umbridge won't know what's hit her.\" \"Well, come on,\" said Hermione, jumping up, \"we'd better get going, if she's inspecting Binns's class we don't want to be late. . . .\" But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in Snape's dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry's moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner. \"I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,\" said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, passing back their homework. \"This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.\" Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them. \"The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week's essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D's.\" He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, \"Some people got D's? Ha!\" Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information private. Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione's but it was at least blue rather than pink, like Neville's, and he delivered a flask of it to Snape's desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief. \"Well, that wasn't as bad as last week, was it?\" said Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall toward lunch. \"And the homework didn't go too badly either, did it?\" When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, \"I mean, all right, I didn't expect the top grade, not if he's marking to O.W.L. standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn't you say?\" Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat. \"Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we've got plenty of time to improve, but the grades we're getting now are a sort of baseline, aren't they? Something we can build on . . .\" They sat down together at the Gryffindor table. \"Obviously, I'd have been thrilled if I'd gotten an O —\" \"Hermione,\" said Ron sharply, \"if you want to know what grades we got, ask.\" \"I don't — I didn't mean — well, if you want to tell me —\" \"I got a P,\" said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. \"Happy?\" \"Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of,\" said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry's right. \"Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.\" \"But,\" said Hermione, \"doesn't P stand for . . .\" \" 'Poor,' yeah,\" said Lee Jordan. \"Still, better than D, isn't it? 'Dreadful'?\" Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades. \"So top grade's O for 'Outstanding,' \" she was saying, \"and then there's A —\" \"No, E,\" George corrected her, \"E for 'Exceeds Expectations.' And I've always thought Fred and I should've got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.\" They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, \"So after E, it's A for 'Acceptable,' and that's the last pass grade, isn't it?\" \"Yep,\" said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth, and swallowing it whole. \"Then you get P for 'Poor' \" — Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration — \"and D for 'Dreadful.' \" \"And then T,\" George reminded him. \"T?\" asked Hermione, looking appalled. \"Even lower than a D? What on earth does that stand for?\" \" 'Troll,' \" said George promptly. Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received T's in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on. \"You lot had an inspected lesson yet?\" Fred asked them. \"No,\" said Hermione at once, \"have you?\" \"Just now, before lunch,\" said George. \"Charms.\" \"What was it like?\" Harry and Hermione asked together. Fred shrugged. \"Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard. You know what Flitwick's like, he treated her like a guest, didn't seem to bother him at all. She didn't say much. Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it.\" \"I can't see old Flitwick getting marked down,\" said George, \"he usually gets everyone through their exams all right.\" \"Who've you got this afternoon?\" Fred asked Harry. \"Trelawney —\" \"A T if ever I saw one —\" \"— and Umbridge herself.\" \"Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,\" said George. \"Angelina'll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.\" But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out Dream Oracles, look round. \"Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,\" said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile. \"You received my note, I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?\" Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney's seat. She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin. Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses. \"We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,\" she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly. \"Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each other's latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.\" She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Um-bridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati's most recent dream. Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney's wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book. \"Think of a dream, quick,\" he told Ron, \"in case the old toad comes our way.\" \"I did it last time,\" Ron protested, \"it's your turn, you tell me one.\" \"Oh, I dunno . . .\" said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. \"Let's say I dreamed I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that'll do. . . .\" Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle. \"Okay, we've got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject . . . would that be 'drowning' or 'cauldron' or 'Snape'?\" \"It doesn't matter, pick any of them,\" said Harry, chancing a glance behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney's shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary. \"What night did you dream this again?\" Ron said, immersed in calculations. \"I dunno, last night, whenever you like,\" Harry told him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out. \"Now,\" said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, \"you've been in this post how long, exactly?\" Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, \"Nearly sixteen years.\" \"Quite a period,\" said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. \"So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?\" \"That's right,\" said Professor Trelawney shortly. Professor Umbridge made another note. \"And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?\" \"Yes,\" said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher. Another note on the clipboard. \"But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?\" \"These things often skip — er — three generations,\" said Professor Trelawney. Professor Umbridge's toadlike smile widened. \"Of course,\" she said sweetly, making yet another note. \"Well, if you could just predict something for me, then?\" She looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Professor Trelawney had stiffened as though unable to believe her ears. \"I don't understand you,\" said Professor Trelawney, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck. \"I'd like you to make a prediction for me,\" said Professor Umbridge very clearly. Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height, her beads and bangles clinking. \"The Inner Eye does not See upon command!\" she said in scandalized tones. \"I see,\" said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her clipboard. \"I — but — but . . . wait!\" said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. \"I . . . I think I do see something . . . something that concerns you. . . . Why, I sense something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril . . .\" Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Um-bridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised. \"I am afraid . . . I am afraid that you are in grave danger!\" Professor Trelawney finished dramatically. There was a pause. Professor Umbridge's eyebrows were still raised. \"Right,\" she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more. \"Well, if that's really the best you can do . . .\" She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron's eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: They both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney's side — until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that was. \"Well?\" she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry's nose, uncharacteristically brisk. \"Let me see the start you've made on your dream diary, please.\" And by the time she had interpreted Harry's dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic toward her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later. She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell. \"Wands away,\" she instructed them all smilingly, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags. \"As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, 'Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation.' There will be no need to talk.\" Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year's lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again. Professor Umbridge had noticed too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione, she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, \"What is it this time, Miss Granger?\" \"I've already read chapter two,\" said Hermione. \"Well then, proceed to chapter three.\" \"I've read that too. I've read the whole book.\" Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly. \"Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen.\" \"He says that counterjinxes are improperly named,\" said Hermione promptly. \"He says 'counterjinx' is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.\" Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows, and Harry knew she was impressed against her will. \"But I disagree,\" Hermione continued. Professor Umbridge's eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder. \"You disagree?\" \"Yes, I do,\" said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the class's attention. \"Mr. Slinkhard doesn't like jinxes, does he? But I think they can be very useful when they're used defensively.\" \"Oh, you do, do you?\" said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. \"Well, I'm afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard's opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.\" \"But —\" Hermione began. \"That is enough,\" said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. \"Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House.\" There was an outbreak of muttering at this. \"What for?\" said Harry angrily. \"Don't you get involved!\" Hermione whispered urgently to him. \"For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,\" said Professor Umbridge smoothly. \"I am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but as none of them — with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects — would have passed a Ministry inspection —\" \"Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,\" said Harry loudly, \"there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.\" This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then — \"I think another week's detentions would do you some good, Mr. Potter,\" said Umbridge sleekly. The cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and by the following morning, it was bleeding again. He did not complain during the evening's detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter. The very worst part of this second week's worth of detentions was, just as George had predicted, Angelina's reaction. She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table. \"Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But Professor — he's gone and landed himself in detention again —\" \"What's this, Potter?\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry. \"Detention? From whom?\" \"From Professor Umbridge,\" muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall's beady, square-framed eyes. \"Are you telling me,\" she said, lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, \"that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge's class again?\" \"Yes,\" Harry muttered, speaking to the floor. \"Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for serious trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But — what? Professor, no!\" Harry said, furious at this injustice. \"I'm already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well?\" \"Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you what- soever!\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. \"No, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy!\" She strode back toward the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which Harry flung himself onto the bench beside Ron, fuming. \"She's taken points off Gryffindor because I'm having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?\" \"I know, mate,\" said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto Harry's plate, \"she's bang out of order.\" Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing. \"You think McGonagall was right, do you?\" said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione's face. \"I wish she hadn't taken points from you, but I think she's right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,\" said Hermione's voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech. Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger; Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head. \"Excellent,\" whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. \"Let's see Umbridge get what she deserves.\" Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there. \"That will do,\" she said and silence fell immediately. \"Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown, please take this box of mice — don't be silly, girl, they won't hurt you — and hand one to each student —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back Harry's essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A. \"Right then, everyone, listen closely — Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention — most of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell. Today we shall be —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Professor Umbridge. \"Yes?\" said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line. \"I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec —\" \"Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,\" said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks of glee. \"As I was saying, today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell —\" \"Hem, hem.\" \"I wonder,\" said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, \"how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.\" Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more. \"As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So — you know the incantation, let me see what you can do. . . .\" \"How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge!\" Harry said to Ron under his voice, but he was grinning; his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated. Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought that Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however, take many more notes while she sat in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim expression on her face. \"Well, it's a start,\" said Ron, holding up a long, wriggling mouse tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around. As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teacher's desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop. \"How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\" Professor Um-bridge asked. \"Thirty-nine years this December,\" said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut. Professor Umbridge made a note. \"Very well,\" she said, \"you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days' time.\" \"I can hardly wait,\" said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off toward the door. \"Hurry up, you three,\" she added, sweeping Harry, Ron, and Hermione before her. Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return. He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong. When they walked down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"You do not usually take this class, is that correct?\" Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living twigs. \"Quite correct,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet. \"I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.\" Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry. \"Hmm,\" said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly, \"I wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid's very extended leave of absence?\" Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly. \" 'Fraid I can't,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. \"Don't know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks teaching work, accepted — that's as much as I know. Well . . . shall I get started then?\" \"Yes, please do,\" said Professor Umbridge, scribbling upon her clipboard. Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among the students, questioning them on magical creatures. Most people were able to answer well and Harry's spirits lifted somewhat; at least the class was not letting Hagrid down. \"Overall,\" said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor GrubblyPlank's side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, \"how do you, as a temporary member of staff — an objective outsider, I suppose  you might say — how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management?\" \"Oh, yes, Dumbledore's excellent,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily. \"No, I'm very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.\" Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on, \"And what are you planning to cover with this class this year — assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return?\" \"Oh, I'll take them through the creatures that most often come up in O.W.L.,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"Not much left to do — they've studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we'd cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know. . . .\" \"Well, you seem to know what you're doing, at any rate,\" said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis she put on \"you\" and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle: \"Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class?\" Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question. \"That was me,\" he said. \"I was slashed by a hippogriff.\" \"A hippogriff?\" said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically. \"Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,\" said Harry angrily. Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harry's direction. \"Another night's detention, I think,\" she said softly. \"Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that's all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.\" \"Jolly good,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Um-bridge set off back across the lawn to the castle. It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge's office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical. \"Here,\" she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward him, \"soak your hand in that, it's a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.\" Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down. \"Thanks,\" he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks's ears with his left hand. \"I still reckon you should complain about this,\" said Ron in a low voice. \"No,\" said Harry flatly. \"McGonagall would go nuts if she knew —\" \"Yeah, she probably would,\" said Harry. \"And how long d'you reckon it'd take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?\" Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way. \"She's an awful woman,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \"Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we've got to do something about her.\" \"I suggested poison,\" said Ron grimly. \"No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any defense from her at all,\" said Hermione. \"Well, what can we do about that?\" said Ron, yawning. \" 'S too late, isn't it? She got the job, she's here to stay, Fudge'll make sure of that.\" \"Well,\" said Hermione tentatively. \"You know, I was thinking today. . . .\" She shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, \"I was thinking that — maybe the time's come when we should just — just do it ourselves.\" \"Do what ourselves?\" said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles. \"Well — learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves,\" said Hermione. \"Come off it,\" groaned Ron. \"You want us to do extra work? D'you realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week?\" \"But this is much more important than homework!\" said Hermione. Harry and Ron goggled at her. \"I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework,\" said Ron. \"Don't be silly, of course there is!\" said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in her. \"It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting out there. It's about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don't learn anything for a whole year —\" \"We can't do much by ourselves,\" said Ron in a defeated voice. \"I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose —\" \"No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,\" said Hermione. \"We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we're going wrong.\" \"If you're talking about Lupin . . .\" Harry began. \"No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,\" said Hermione. \"He's too busy with the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that's not nearly often enough.\" \"Who, then?\" said Harry, frowning at her. Hermione heaved a very deep sigh. \"Isn't it obvious?\" she said. \"I'm talking about you, Harry.\" There was a moment's silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered. \"About me what?\" said Harry. \"I'm talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.\" Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry's consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated. He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, \"That's an idea.\" \"What's an idea?\" said Harry. \"You,\" said Ron. \"Teaching us to do it.\" \"But . . .\" Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg. \"But I'm not a teacher, I can't —\" \"Harry, you're the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione. \"Me?\" said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. \"No I'm not, you've beaten me in every test —\" \"Actually, I haven't,\" said Hermione coolly. \"You beat me in our third year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I'm not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you've done!\" \"How d'you mean?\" \"You know what, I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,\" Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. \"Let's think,\" he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. \"Uh . . . first year — you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.\" \"But that was luck,\" said Harry, \"that wasn't skill —\" \"Second year,\" Ron interrupted, \"you killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle.\" \"Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up I —\" \"Third year,\" said Ron, louder still, \"you fought off about a hundred dementors at once —\" \"You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't —\" \"Last year,\" Ron said, almost shouting now, \"you fought off YouKnow-Who again —\" \"Listen to me!\" said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. \"Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck — I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I didn't plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help —\" Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn't even sure why he was feeling so angry. \"Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn't I?\" he said heatedly. \"I know what went on, all right? And I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because — because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right — but I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing — STOP LAUGHING!\" The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn't remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and Hermione's smiles had vanished. \"You don't know what it's like! You — neither of you — you've never had to face him, have you? You think it's just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you're in class or something? The whole time you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own — your own brain or guts or whatever — like you can think straight when you know you're about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die — they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that — and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up — you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me —\" \"We weren't saying anything like that, mate,\" said Ron, looking aghast. \"We weren't having a go at Diggory, we didn't — you've got the wrong end of the —\" He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken. \"Harry,\" she said timidly, \"don't you see? This . . . this is exactly why we need you. . . . We need to know what it's r-really like . . . facing him . . . facing V-Voldemort.\" It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort's name, and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry. Still breathing hard, he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence. \"Well . . . think about it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"Please?\" Harry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed of his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was agreeing to. Hermione stood up. \"Well, I'm off to bed,\" she said in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it. \"Erm . . . 'night.\" Ron had gotten to his feet too. \"Coming?\" he said awkwardly to Harry. \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"In . . . in a minute. I'll just clear this up.\" He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left. \"Reparo,\" Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china. They flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl. He was suddenly so tired that he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead he got to his feet and followed Ron upstairs. His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors, and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again.\n",

      "Harry's question was answered the very next morning. When Hermione's Daily Prophet arrived she smoothed it out, gazed for a moment at the front page, and then gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her. \"What?\" said Harry and Ron together. For an answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards' faces and the tenth, a witch's. Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures, looking insolent. Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban. Antonin Dolohov, read the legend beneath a wizard with a long, pale, twisted face who was sneering up at Harry, convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett. Augustus Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture, CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic Secrets to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. But Harry's eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page. She had long, dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he had seen it sleek, thick, and shining. She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth. Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but something — perhaps Azkaban — had taken most of her beauty. Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom. Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures, which Harry, concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read. MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN MINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS \"RALLYING POINT\" FOR OLD DEATH EATERS \"Black?\" said Harry loudly. \"Not — ?\" \"Shhh!\" whispered Hermione desperately. \"Not so loud — just read it!\" The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban. Speaking to reporters in his private office, Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, confirmed that ten high-security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening, and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals. \"We find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped,\" said Fudge last night. \"Nor do we think the two breakouts are unrelated. An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help, and we must remember that Black, as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban, would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps. We think it likely that these individuals, who include Black's cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black as their leader. We are, however, doing all we can to round up the criminals and beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious. On no account should any of these individuals be approached.\" \"There you are, Harry,\" said Ron, looking awestruck. \"That's why he was happy last night. . . .\" \"I don't believe this,\" snarled Harry, \"Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius?\" \"What other options does he have?\" said Hermione bitterly. \"He can hardly say, 'Sorry everyone, Dumbledore warned me this might happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort' — stop whimpering, Ron — 'and now Voldemort's worst supporters have broken out too.' I mean, he's spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars, hasn't he?\" Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall. He could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of them took the newspaper every day like Hermione. There they all were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish, and outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen Voldemort's ranks. . . . He glanced up at the staff table. It was a different story here:CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave. Professor Sprout had the Prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon. Meanwhile, at the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge. For once her pouchy toad's eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for misbehaving students. She scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so intently. \"Oh my —\" said Hermione wonderingly, still staring at the newspaper. \"What now?\" said Harry quickly; he was feeling jumpy. \"It's . . . horrible,\" said Hermione, looking shaken. She folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it back to Harry and Ron. TRAGIC DEMISE OF MINISTRY OF MAGIC WORKER St. Mungo's Hospital promised a full inquiry last night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderick Bode, 49, was discovered dead in his bed, strangled by a potted-plant. Healers called to the scene were unable to revive Mr. Bode, who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death. Healer Miriam Strout, who was in charge of Mr. Bode's ward at the time of the incident, has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable for comment yesterday, but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a statement, \"St. Mungo's deeply regrets the death of Mr. Bode, whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident. \"We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that Healer Strout, busy over the Christmas period, overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr. Bode's bedside table. As his speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to look after the plant himself, unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom, but a cutting of Devil's Snare, which, when touched by the convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him instantly. \"St. Mungo's is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward.\" \"Bode . . .\" said Ron. \"Bode. It rings a bell. . . .\" \"We saw him,\" Hermione whispered. \"In St. Mungo's, remember? He was in the bed opposite Lockhart's, just lying there, staring at the ceiling. And we saw the Devil's Snare arrive. She — the Healer — said it was a Christmas present. . . .\" Harry looked back at the story. A feeling of horror was rising like bile in his throat. \"How come we didn't recognize Devil's Snare . . . ? We've seen it before . . . we could've stopped this from happening . . .\" \"Who expects Devil's Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a potted plant?\" said Ron sharply. \"It's not our fault, whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame! They must be a real prat, why didn't they check what they were buying?\" \"Oh come on, Ron!\" said Hermione shakily, \"I don't think anyone could put Devil's Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it? This — this was murder. . . . A clever murder, as well. . . . If the plant was sent anonymously, how's anyone ever going to find out who did it?\" Harry was not thinking about Devil's Snare. He was rememberingCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE taking the lift down to the ninth level of the Ministry on the day of his hearing, and the sallow-faced man who had got in on the Atrium level. \"I met Bode,\" he said slowly. \"I saw him at the Ministry with your dad . . .\" Ron's mouth fell open. \"I've heard Dad talk about him at home! He was an Unspeakable — he worked in the Department of Mysteries!\" They looked at one another for a moment, then Hermione pulled the newspaper back toward her, closed it, glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front, then leapt to her feet. \"Where are you going?\" said Ron, startled. \"To send a letter,\" said Hermione, swinging her bag onto her shoulder. \"It . . . well, I don't know whether . . . but it's worth trying . . . and I'm the only one who can . . .\" \"I hate it when she does that,\" grumbled Ron as he and Harry got up from the table and made their own, slower way out of the Great Hall. \"Would it kill her to tell us what she's up to for once? It'd take her about ten more seconds — hey, Hagrid!\" Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the entrance hall, waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass. He was still as heavily bruised as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose. \"All righ', you two?\" he said, trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained grimace. \"Are you okay, Hagrid?\" asked Harry, following him as he lumbered after the Ravenclaws. \"Fine, fine,\" said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness; he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened-looking Professor Vector, who was passing. \"Jus' busy, yeh know, usual stuff — lessons ter prepare — couple o' salamanders got scale rot — an' I'm on probation,\" he mumbled. \"You're on probation?\" said Ron very loudly, so that many students passing looked around curiously. \"Sorry — I mean — you're on probation?\" he whispered. \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid. \" 'S'no more'n I expected, ter tell yeh the truth. Yeh migh' not've picked up on it, bu' that inspection didn' go too well, yeh know . . . anyway,\" he sighed deeply. \"Bes' go an rub a bit more chili powder on them salamanders or their tails'll be hangin' off 'em next. See yeh, Harry . . . Ron . . .\" He trudged away, out the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds. Harry watched him go, wondering how much more bad news he could stand. The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days, but to Harry's indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people, Draco Malfoy prominent among them, seemed positively gleeful. As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St. Mungo's, Harry, Ron, and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared. There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers. Rumors were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had done. Those who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemort's; the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemort's reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives of CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, who had an uncle, aunt, and cousins who had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry. \"And I don't know how you stand it, it's horrible,\" she said bluntly, dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort. It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers' voices. They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophet's version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of Azkaban fortress. In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them, the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year. It was not only the students' mood that had changed. It was now quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low, urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the moment they saw students approaching. \"They obviously can't talk freely in the staffroom anymore,\" said Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry, and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day. \"Not with Umbridge there.\" \"Reckon they know anything new?\" said Ron, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers. \"If they do, we're not going to hear about it, are we?\" said Harry angrily. \"Not after Decree . . . What number are we on now?\" For new signs had appeared on the house notice boards the morning after news of the Azkaban breakout: —  by order of — The High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any information that is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach. The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-six. Signed: high inquisitor This latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students. Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class. \"Exploding Snap's got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor! That's not information relating to your subject!\" When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly. Harry recommended essence of murtlap. Harry had thought that the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little, that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under her beloved Fudge's nose. It seemed, however, to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspect of life at Hogwarts under her personal control. SheCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long, and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid who went first. Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and her clipboard. She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, interrupting Professor Trelawney's increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about Ornithomancy and Heptomology, insisting that she predict students' answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves, and the rune stones in turn. Harry thought that Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain; several times he passed her in the corridors (in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room), muttering wildly to herself, wringing her hands, and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder, all the time giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry. If he had not been so worried about Hagrid, he would have felt sorry for her — but if one of them was to be ousted out of a job, there could be only one choice for Harry as to who should remain. Unfortunately, Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney. Though he seemed to be following Hermione's advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a crup, a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for its forked tail, since before Christmas, he also seemed to have lost his nerve. He was oddly distracted and jumpy in lessons, losing the thread of what he was saying while talking to the class, answering questions wrongly and glancing anxiously at Umbridge all the time. He was also more distant with Harry, Ron, and Hermione than he had ever been before, expressly forbidding them to visit him after dark. \"If she catches yeh, it'll be all of our necks on the line,\" he told them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that jeopardized his job further, they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings. It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at Hogwarts worth living: visits to Hagrid's house, letters from Sirius, his Firebolt, and Quidditch. He took his revenge the only way he had: redoubling his efforts for the D.A. Harry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville. The news of his parents' attacker's escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him. He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, Ron, and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungo's, and taking their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers' escape; in fact, he barely spoke during D.A. meetings anymore, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and countercurse Harry taught them, his plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents, working harder than anyone else in the room. He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm, a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker, only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville. In fact Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during D.A. meetings. Harry's sessions with Snape, which had started badly enough, were not improving; on the contrary, Harry felt he was getting worse with every lesson. Before he had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of Voldemort's thoughts or moods that he experienced every now and then. Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time, which wereCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort's mood, and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor toward the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams that always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door. \"Maybe it's a bit like an illness,\" said Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron. \"A fever or something. It has to get worse before it gets better.\" \"It's lessons with Snape that are making it worse,\" said Harry flatly. \"I'm getting sick of my scar hurting, and I'm getting bored walking down that corridor every night.\" He rubbed his forehead angrily. \"I just wish the door would open, I'm sick of standing staring at it —\" \"That's not funny,\" said Hermione sharply. \"Dumbledore doesn't want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn't have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. You're just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons.\" \"I am working!\" said Harry, nettled. \"You try it sometime, Snape trying to get inside your head, it's not a bundle of laughs, you know!\" \"Maybe . . .\" said Ron slowly. \"Maybe what?\" said Hermione rather snappishly. \"Maybe it's not Harry's fault he can't close his mind,\" said Ron darkly. \"What do you mean?\" said Hermione. \"Well, maybe Snape isn't really trying to help Harry. . . .\" Harry and Hermione stared at him. Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other. \"Maybe,\" he said again in a lower voice, \"he's actually trying to open Harry's mind a bit wider . . . make it easier for You-Know —\" \"Shut up, Ron,\" said Hermione angrily. \"How many times have  you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.\" \"He used to be a Death Eater,\" said Ron stubbornly. \"And we've never seen proof that he really swapped sides. . . .\" \"Dumbledore trusts him,\" Hermione repeated. \"And if we can't trust Dumbledore, we can't trust anyone.\" With so much to worry about and so much to do — startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth years working until past midnight, secret D.A. meetings, and regular classes with Snape — January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast. Before Harry knew it, February had arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year. Harry had had very little time to spare on conversations with Cho since they had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found himself facing a Valentine's Day spent entirely in her company. On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully. He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls. Hedwig was not there — not that he had expected her — but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down. \"And about time! If it hadn't come today . . .\" she said eagerly, tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment. Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face. \"Listen, Harry,\" she said, looking up at him. \"This is really important. . . . Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday?\" \"Well . . . I dunno,\" said Harry dubiously. \"Cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her. We never said what we were going to do.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE \"Well, bring her along if you must,\" said Hermione urgently. \"But will you come?\" \"Well . . . all right, but why?\" \"I haven't got time to tell you now, I've got to answer this quickly —\" And she hurried out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of uneaten toast in the other. \"Are you coming?\" Harry asked Ron, but he shook his head, looking glum. \"I can't come into Hogsmeade at all, Angelina wants a full day's training. Like it's going to help — we're the worst team I've ever seen. You should see Sloper and Kirke, they're pathetic, even worse than I am.\" He heaved a great sigh. \"I dunno why Angelina won't just let me resign. . . .\" \"It's because you're good when you're on form, that's why,\" said Harry irritably. He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron's plight when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff. Ron seemed to notice Harry's tone, because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said good-bye to each other shortly afterward. Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and Harry, after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the entrance hall to meet Cho, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about. She was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors, looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long ponytail. Harry's feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked toward her, and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they looked swinging at his sides. \"Hi,\" said Cho slightly breathlessly. \"Hi,\" said Harry. They stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, \"Well — er — shall we go, then?\" \"Oh — yes . . .\" They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occasionally catching each other's eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking to each other. Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air, finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand there looking awkward. It was a fresh, breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium, Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them. . . . \"You really miss it, don't you?\" said Cho. He looked around and saw her watching him. \"Yeah,\" sighed Harry. \"I do.\" \"Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third year?\" she asked him. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, grinning. \"You kept blocking me.\" \"And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to,\" said Cho, smiling reminiscently. \"I heard he got taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right?\" \"Nah, it was Puddlemere United, I saw him at the World Cup last year.\" \"Oh, I saw you there too, remember? We were on the same campsite. It was really good, wasn't it?\" The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates. Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her, no more difficult, in fact, than talking to Ron and Hermione, and he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson.CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE \"Potter and Chang!\" screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles. \"Urgh, Chang, I don't think much of your taste. . . . At least Diggory was good-looking!\" They sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet. \"So . . . where d'you want to go?\" Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements. \"Oh . . . I don't mind,\" said Cho, shrugging. \"Um . . . shall we just have a look in the shops or something?\" They wandered toward Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the ten pictures of the escaped Death Eaters. The poster (\"By Order of the Ministry of Magic\") offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information relating to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured. \"It's funny, isn't it,\" said Cho in a low voice, also gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters. \"Remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there aren't dementors anywhere. . . .\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange's face to glance up and down the High Street. \"Yeah, it is weird. . . .\" He was not sorry that there were no dementors nearby, but now he came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. They had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they were not bothering to look for them. . . . It looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now. The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft's; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck. \"Um . . . d'you want to get a coffee?\" said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily. \"Yeah, all right,\" said Harry, looking around. \"Where — ?\" \"Oh, there's a really nice place just up here, haven't you ever been to Madam Puddifoot's?\" she said brightly, and she led him up a side road and into a small tea shop that Harry had never noticed before. It was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbridge's office. \"Cute, isn't it?\" said Cho happily. \"Er . . . yeah,\" said Harry untruthfully. \"Look, she's decorated it for Valentine's Day!\" said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants. \"Aaah . . .\" They sat down at the last remaining table, which was situated in the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the tea shop, he saw that it was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand. \"What can I get you, m'dears?\" said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Davies's with great difficulty. \"Two coffees, please,\" said Cho. In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they wouldn't; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which ChoCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE would soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he could not see the street outside. To postpone the moment when he had to look at Cho he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub. After a few more painful minutes Cho mentioned Umbridge; Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during D.A. meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say. \"Er . . . listen, d'you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime? I'm meeting Hermione Granger there.\" Cho raised her eyebrows. \"You're meeting Hermione Granger? Today?\" \"Yeah. Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. D'you want to come with me? She said it wouldn't matter if you did.\" \"Oh . . . well . . . that was nice of her.\" But Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all; on the contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding. A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup. Next door, Roger Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together by the lips. Cho's hand was lying on the table beside her coffee, and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it. Just do it, he told himself, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest. Just reach out and grab it. . . . Amazing how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair . . . But just as he moved his hand forward, Cho took hers off the table. She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression. \"He asked me out, you know,\" she said in a quiet voice. \"A couple of weeks ago. Roger. I turned him down, though.\" Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why she was telling him this. If she wished she were sitting at the table next door being heartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come out with him? He said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink. \"I came in here with Cedric last year,\" said Cho. In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, Harry's insides had become glacial. He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads. Cho's voice was rather higher when she spoke again. \"I've been meaning to ask you for ages. . . . Did Cedric — did he m-m-mention me at all before he died?\" This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with Cho. \"Well — no —\" he said quietly. \"There — there wasn't time for him to say anything. Erm . . . so . . . d'you . . . d'you get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays? You support the Tornados, right?\" His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To his horror, he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been after the last D.A. meeting before Christmas. \"Look,\" he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could overhear, \"let's not talk about Cedric right now. . . . Let's talk about something else. . . .\" But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE \"I thought,\" she said, tears spattering down onto the table. \"I thought you'd u-u-understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n-need to talk about it t-too! I mean, you saw it happen, d-didn't you?\" Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies' girlfriend had even unglued herself to look around at Cho crying. \"Well — I have talked about it,\" Harry said in a whisper, \"to Ron and Hermione, but —\" \"Oh, you'll talk to Hermione Granger!\" she said shrilly, her face now shining with tears, and several more kissing couples broke apart to stare. \"But you won't talk to me! P-perhaps it would be best if we just . . . just p-paid and you went and met up with Hermione G-Granger, like you obviously want to!\" Harry stared at her, utterly bewildered, as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it. \"Cho?\" he said weakly, wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho. \"Go on, leave!\" she said, now crying into the napkin. \"I don't know why you asked me out in the first place if you're going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me. . . . How many are you meeting after Hermione?\" \"It's not like that!\" said Harry, and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed, which he realized a split second too late was a mistake. Cho sprang to her feet. The whole tearoom was quiet, and everybody was watching them now. \"I'll see you around, Harry,\" she said dramatically, and hiccuping slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open, and hurried off into the pouring rain. \"Cho!\" Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle. There was total silence within the tea shop. Every eye was upon Harry. He threw a Galleon down onto the table, shook pink confetti out of his eyes, and followed Cho out of the door. It was raining hard now, and she was nowhere to be seen. He simply did not understand what had happened; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine. \"Women!\" he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed street with his hands in his pockets. \"What did she want to talk about Cedric for anyway? Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe?\" He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. He knew he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time. He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose. \"Hi, Hagrid!\" he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him. Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognized him. Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises. \"Oh, it's you, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"You all righ'?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" lied Harry; in fact, next to this battered and mournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he did not have much to complain about. \"Er — are you okay?\" \"Me?\" said Hagrid. \"Oh yeah, I'm grand, Harry, grand. . . .\" He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size of a large bucket, and sighed. Harry did not know what to say to him. They sat side by side in silence for a moment. Then Hagrid said abruptly, \"In the same boat, you an' me, aren' we, Harry?\" \"Er —\" said Harry. \"Yeah . . . I've said it before. . . . Both outsiders, like,\" said Hagrid, nodding wisely. \"An' both orphans. Yeah . . . both orphans.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE He took a great swig from his tankard. \"Makes a diff'rence, havin' a decent family,\" he said. \"Me dad was decent. An' your mum an' dad were decent. If they'd lived, life woulda bin diff 'rent, eh?\" \"Yeah . . . I s'pose,\" said Harry cautiously. Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood. \"Family,\" said Hagrid gloomily. \"Whatever yeh say, blood's important. . . .\" And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye. \"Hagrid,\" said Harry, unable to stop himself, \"where are you getting all these injuries?\" \"Eh?\" said Hagrid, looking startled. \"Wha' injuries?\" \"All those!\" said Harry, pointing at Hagrid's face. \"Oh . . . tha's jus' normal bumps an' bruises, Harry,\" said Hagrid dismissively. \"I got a rough job.\" He drained his tankard, set it back upon the table, and got to his feet. \"I'll be seein' yeh, Harry. . . . Take care now. . . .\" And he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and then disappeared into the torrential rain. Harry watched him go, feeling miserable. Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he seemed determined not to accept help. What was going on? But before Harry could think about the matter any further, he heard a voice calling his name. \"Harry! Harry, over here!\" Hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room. He got up and made his way toward her through the crowded pub. He was still a few tables away when he realized that Hermione was not alone; she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter, ex-journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermione's least favorite people in the world. \"You're early!\" said Hermione, moving along to give him room to sit down. \"I thought you were with Cho, I wasn't expecting you for another hour at least!\" \"Cho?\" said Rita at once, twisting around in her seat to stare avidly at Harry. \"A girl ?\" She snatched up her crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it. \"It's none of your business if Harry's been with a hundred girls,\" Hermione told Rita coolly. \"So you can put that away right now.\" Rita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid-green quill from her bag. Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap, she snapped her bag shut again. \"What are you up to?\" Harry asked, sitting down and staring from Rita to Luna to Hermione. \"Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,\" said Rita, taking a large slurp of her drink. \"I suppose I'm allowed to talk to him, am I?\" she shot at Hermione. \"Yes, I suppose you are,\" said Hermione coldly. Unemployment did not suit Rita. The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face. The scarlet paint on her two-inch talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses. She took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth, \"Pretty girl, is she, Harry?\" \"One more word about Harry's love life and the deal's off and that's a promise,\" said Hermione irritably. \"What deal?\" said Rita, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. \"You haven't mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy, you just told me to turn up. Oh, one of these days . . .\" She took a deep shuddering breath. \"Yes, yes, one of these days you'll write more horrible stories about Harry and me,\" said Hermione indifferently. \"Find someone who cares, why don't you?\" \"They've run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this yearCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE without my help,\" said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, \"How has that made you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?\" \"He feels angry, of course,\" said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. \"Because he's told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister's too much of an idiot to believe him.\" \"So you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?\" said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag. \"You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore's been telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness — ?\" \"I wasn't the sole witness,\" snarled Harry. \"There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?\" \"I'd love them,\" breathed Rita, now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. \"A great bold headline: 'Potter Accuses . . .' A subheading: 'Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us.' And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you: 'Disturbed teenage survivor of You-KnowWho's attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the Wizarding community of being Death Eaters. . . .'\" The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression died out of her face. \"But of course,\" she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione, \"Little Miss Perfect wouldn't want that story out there, would she?\" \"As a matter of fact,\" said Hermione sweetly, \"that's exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.\" Rita stared at her. So did Harry. Luna, on the other hand, sang, \"Weasley Is Our King\" dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick. \"You want me to report what he says about He-Who-Must-NotBe-Named?\" Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice. \"Yes, I do,\" said Hermione. \"The true story. All the facts. Exactly as Harry reports them. He'll give you all the details, he'll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he'll tell you what Voldemort looks like now — oh, get a grip on yourself,\" she added contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for at the sound of Voldemort's name, Rita had jumped so badly that she had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself. Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione. Then she said baldly, \"The Prophet wouldn't print it. In case you haven't noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story. Everyone thinks he's delusional. Now, if you let me write the story from that angle —\" \"We don't need another story about how Harry's lost his marbles!\" said Hermione angrily. \"We've had plenty of those already, thank you! I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth!\" \"There's no market for a story like that,\" said Rita coldly. \"You mean the Prophet won't print it because Fudge won't let them,\" said Hermione irritably. Rita gave Hermione a long, hard look. Then, leaning forward across the table toward her, she said in a businesslike tone, \"All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing. They won't print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to read it. It's against the public mood. This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough. People just don't want to believe You-Know-Who's back.\" \"So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it?\" said Hermione scathingly. Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of firewhisky. \"The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,\" she said coldly.CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE \"My dad thinks it's an awful paper,\" said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly. Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eyes. \"He publishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know. He doesn't care about making money.\" Rita looked disparagingly at Luna. \"I'm guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter?\" she said. \" 'Twenty-five Ways to Mingle with Muggles' and the dates of the next Bring-and-Fly Sale?\" \"No,\" said Luna, dipping her onion back into her gillywater, \"he's the editor of The Quibbler.\" Rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked around in alarm. \" 'Important stories he thinks the public needs to know'?\" she said witheringly. \"I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag.\" \"Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn't it?\" said Hermione pleasantly. \"Luna says her father's quite happy to take Harry's interview. That's who'll be publishing it.\" Rita stared at them both for a moment and then let out a great whoop of laughter. \"The Quibbler!\" she said, cackling. \"You think people will take him seriously if he's published in The Quibbler?\" \"Some people won't,\" said Hermione in a level voice. \"But the Daily Prophet's version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it. I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn't a better explanation of what happened, and if there's an alternative story available, even if it is published in a\" — she glanced sideways at Luna, \"in a — well, an unusual magazine — I think they might be rather keen to read it.\" Rita did not say anything for a while, but eyed Hermione shrewdly, her head a little to one side. \"All right, let's say for a moment I'll do it,\" she said abruptly. \"What kind of fee am I going to get?\" \"I don't think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine,\" said Luna dreamily. \"They do it because it's an honor, and, of course, to see their names in print.\" Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione. \"I'm supposed to do this for free?\" \"Well, yes,\" said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink. \"Otherwise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider's account of life in Azkaban. . . .\" Rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of Hermione's drink and thrust it up her nose. \"I don't suppose I've got any choice, have I?\" said Rita, her voice shaking slightly. She opened her crocodile bag once more, withdrew a piece of parchment, and raised her Quick-Quotes Quill. \"Daddy will be pleased,\" said Luna brightly. A muscle twitched in Rita's jaw. \"Okay, Harry?\" said Hermione, turning to him. \"Ready to tell the public the truth?\" \"I suppose,\" said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them. \"Fire away, then, Rita,\" said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry out of the bottom of her glass.\n",

      "He lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself. A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too. Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes. He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neitherCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be. He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses anymore. Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful. For the first time, he wished he were clothed. Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. He took them and pulled them on: They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared, just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . . He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . . Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear, domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for — He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath. He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him. \"You cannot help.\" He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. \"Harry.\" He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. \"You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.\" Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster's face. Dumbledore's long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet. . . \"But you're dead,\" said Harry. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. \"Then . . . I'm dead too?\" \"Ah,\" said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. \"That is the question, isn't it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.\" They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. \"Not?\" repeated Harry.CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE \"Not,\" said Dumbledore. \"But . . .\" Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. \"But I should have died — I didn't defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!\" \"And that,\" said Dumbledore, \"will, I think, have made all the difference.\" Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light, like fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content. \"Explain,\" said Harry. \"But you already know,\" said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together. \"I let him kill me,\" said Harry. \"Didn't I?\" \"You did,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"Go on!\" \"So the part of his soul that was in me . . .\" Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face. \". . . has it gone?\" \"Oh yes!\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.\" \"But then . . .\" Harry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled under the chair. \"What is that, Professor?\" \"Something that is beyond either of our help,\" said Dumbledore. \"But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,\" Harry started again, \"and nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?\" \"I think you know,\" said Dumbledore. \"Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.\" Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort. \"He took my blood,\" said Harry. \"Precisely!\" said Dumbledore. \"He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!\" \"I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?\" He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again. \"Are you sure we can't do anything?\" \"There is no help possible.\" \"Then explain . . . more,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. \"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. \"And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children's tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. ThatCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. \"He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.\" Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. \"And you knew this? You knew — all along?\" \"I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,\" said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble. \"There's more,\" said Harry. \"There's more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?\" \"As to that, I cannot be sure.\" \"Have a guess, then,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. \"What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted it or explained it to Voldemort. \"Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother's sacrifice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. \"Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was twin of his, had never expected. \"He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. \"I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort's wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius's wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort's own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy's stand?\" \"But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?\" asked Harry. \"My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am sure,\" Dumbledore finished kindly.CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here. \"He killed me with your wand.\" \"He failed to kill you with my wand,\" Dumbledore corrected Harry. \"I think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course,\" he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, \"I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.\" \"I feel great at the moment, though,\" said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. \"Where are we, exactly?\" \"Well, I was going to ask you that,\" said Dumbledore, looking around. \"Where would you say that we are?\" Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready to give. \"It looks,\" he said slowly, \"like King's Cross station. Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.\" \"King's Cross station!\" Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. \"Good gracious, really?\" \"Well, where do you think we are?\" asked Harry, a little defensively. \"My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.\" Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location. \"The Deathly Hallows,\" he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore's face. \"Ah, yes,\" he said. He even looked a little worried. \"Well?\" For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. \"Can you forgive me?\" he said. \"Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore's tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes. \"The Hallows, the Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore. \"A desperate man's dream!\" \"But they're real!\" \"Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I was such a fool. But you know, don't you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.\" \"What do I know?\" Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes. \"Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?\" \"Of course you were,\" said Harry. \"Of course — how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!\" \"True, true,\" said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. \"Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.\" \"Not the way he did,\" said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. \"Hallows, not Horcruxes.\" \"Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore, \"not Horcruxes. Precisely.\"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. \"Grindelwald was looking for them too?\" he asked. Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. \"It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,\" he said quietly. \"Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric's Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.\" \"So it's true?\" asked Harry. \"All of it? The Peverell brothers —\" \"— were the three brothers of the tale,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations. \"The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus's last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric's Hollow.\" Dumbledore smiled at Harry. \"Me?\" \"You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!\" His tone was unbearably bitter. \"The Cloak wouldn't have helped them survive, though,\" Harry said quickly. \"Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn't have made them curse-proof.\" \"True,\" sighed Dumbledore. \"True.\" Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him. \"So you'd given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?\" \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry's eyes. \"You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.\" \"But I don't despise you —\" \"Then you should,\" said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. \"You know the secret of my sister's ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana. \"I resented it, Harry.\" Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry's head, into the distance. \"I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. \"Do not misunderstand me,\" he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. \"I loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, moreCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. \"So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came. . . .\" Dumbledore looked directly into Harry's eyes again. \"Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution. \"Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. \"And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone — to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. \"And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean 'invincible.' \"Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. \"And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow. \"The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother's care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.\" Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control. \"Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. \"Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.\" \"But you'd have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!\" burst out Harry.CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE \"Would I?\" asked Dumbledore heavily. \"I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. \"I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher —\" \"You were the best —\" \"— you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him. \"Oh, not death,\" said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry's questioning look. \"Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. \"I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. \"Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.\" Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore. At last he said, \"Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.\" Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. \"They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . .\" \". . . or maybe from breaking into your tomb?\" suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes. After another short pause Harry said, \"You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.\" Dumbledore nodded. \"When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts — the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons — I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry I was. . . . \"I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.\" \"Why?\" said Harry. \"It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What's wrong with that?\" \"Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. \"But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owner. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.\" Dumbledore patted Harry's hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How could he remain angry with Dumbledore now? \"Why did you have to make it so difficult?\" Dumbledore's smile was tremulous. \"I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.\" \"And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\" \"I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.\" \"But you expected him to go after the wand?\" \"I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort's in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .\" \"If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn't you?\" \"I admit that was my intention,\" said Dumbledore, \"but it did not work as I intended, did it?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"That bit didn't work out.\" The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. TheCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. \"I've got to go back, haven't I?\" \"That is up to you.\" \"I've got a choice?\" \"Oh yes.\" Dumbledore smiled at him. \"We are in King's Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let's say . . . board a train.\" \"And where would it take me?\" \"On,\" said Dumbledore simply. Silence again. \"Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.\" \"True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.\" \"But you want me to go back?\" \"I think,\" said Dumbledore, \"that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.\" Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair. \"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.\" Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other's faces. \"Tell me one last thing,\" said Harry. \"Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?\" Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry's ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. \"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\"\n",

      "Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn't speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off  another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. \"Er — Uncle Vernon?\" Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \"Er — I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.\" Uncle Vernon grunted again. \"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\" Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \"Thank you.\" He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. \"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\" Harry didn't say anything. \"Where is this school, anyway?\" \"I don't know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. \"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock,\" he read. His aunt and uncle stared. \"Platform what?\" \"Nine and three-quarters.\" \"Don't talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and three-quarters.\" \"It's on my ticket.\" \"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see. You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.\" \"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. \"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\" Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes — he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?\" He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. \"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone. He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hog-warts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten. At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. \"— packed with Muggles, of course —\" Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him — and they had an owl. Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. \"Now, what's the platform number?\" said the boys' mother. \"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, \"Mom, can't I go . . .\" \"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\" What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. \"Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said. \"I'm not Fred, I'm George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can't you tell I'm George?\" \"Sorry, George, dear.\" \"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier — he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere. There was nothing else for it. \"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman. \"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too.\" She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is — the thing is, I don't know how to —\" \"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded. \"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\" \"Er — okay,\" said Harry. He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn't be able to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — It didn't come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway  where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it. He had done it. Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I've lost my toad again.\" \"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh. A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. \"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\" The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier. \"Yes, please,\" Harry panted. \"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!\" With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. \"What's that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar. \"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you — ?\" \"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren't you?\" he added to Harry. \"What?\" said Harry. \"Harry Potter,\" chorused the twins. \"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\" The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door. \"Fred? George? Are you there?\" \"Coming, Mom.\" With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. \"Ron, you've got something on your nose.\" The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. \"Mom — geroff.\" He wriggled free. \"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the twins. \"Shut up,\" said Ron. \"Where's Percy?\" said their mother. \"He's coming now.\" The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it. \"Can't stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves —\" \"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\" \"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the other twin. \"Once —\" \"Or twice —\" \"A minute —\" \"All summer —\" \"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect. \"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins. \"Because he's a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.\" She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. \"Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've — you've blown up a toilet or —\" \"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.\" \"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\" \"It's not funny. And look after Ron.\" \"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\" \"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. \"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\" Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking. \"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\" \"Who?\" \"Harry Potter!\" Harry heard the little girl's voice. \"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, oh please. . . .\" \"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\" \"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there — like lightning.\" \"Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\" \"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\" Their mother suddenly became very stern. \"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\" \"All right, keep your hair on.\" A whistle sounded. \"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. \"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls.\" \"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\" \"George!\" \"Only joking, Mom.\" The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving  and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn't know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. \"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \"Everywhere else is full.\" Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. \"Hey, Ron.\" The twins were back. \"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there.\" \"Right,\" mumbled Ron. \"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\" \"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. \"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out. Harry nodded. \"Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got — you know . . .\" He pointed at Harry's forehead. Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. \"So that's where You-Know-Who — ?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can't remember it.\" \"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly. \"Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\" \"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. \"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. \"Er — yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.\" \"So you must know loads of magic already.\" The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. \"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\" \"Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.\" \"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.\" Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. \"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff— I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\" Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. \". . . and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort —\" Ron gasped. \"What?\" said Harry. \"You said You-Know-Who's name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I'd have thought you, of all people —\" \"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, \"I just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to learn. . . . I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I'm the worst in the class.\" \"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\" While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears?\" Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \"Hungry, are you?\" \"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She always forgets I don't like corned beef.\" \"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on —\" \"You don't want this, it's all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn't got much time,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\" \"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \"They're not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. \"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.\" \"What?\" \"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know — Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\" Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man's face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. \"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry. \"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —\" Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE currently headmaster of hogwarts Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the  Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared. \"He's gone!\" \"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He'll be back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her . . . do you want it? You can start collecting.\" Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. \"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\" \"Do they? What, they don't move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed. \"Weird!\" Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. \"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\" Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. \"Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.\" They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper. The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\" When they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\" \"He'll turn up,\" said Harry. \"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him . . .\" He left. \"Don't know why he's so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk.\" The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap. \"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look . . .\" He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. \"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway —\" He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. \"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. \"We've already told him we haven't seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. \"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.\" She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \"Er — all right.\" He cleared his throat. \"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\" He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. \"Are you sure that's a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard — I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it  will be enough — I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\" She said all this very fast. Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either. \"I'm Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered. \"Harry Potter,\" said Harry. \"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\" \"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed. \"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad. . . . Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.\" And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \"Whatever House I'm in, I hope she's not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\" \"What House are your brothers in?\" asked Harry. \"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\" \"That's the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\" \"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. \"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,\" said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off Houses. \"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?\" Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school. \"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.\" Harry stared. \"Really? What happened to them?\" \"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it.\" Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying. \"What's your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked. \"Er — I don't know any,\" Harry confessed. \"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world —\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley. \"Is it true?\" he said. \"They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. \"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \"And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\" Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\" He turned back to Harry. \"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\" He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it. \"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly. Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. \"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.\" Both Harry and Ron stood up. \"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair. \"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered. \"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. \"But we don't feel like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\" Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. \"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. \"I think he's been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \"No — I don't believe it — he's gone back to sleep.\" And so he had. \"You've met Malfoy before?\" Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. \"I've heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to Hermione. \"Can we help you with something?\" \"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!\" \"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would you mind leaving while we change?\" \"All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \"And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\" Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hog- warts in five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\" Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?\" Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \"C'mon, follow me — any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!\" Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. \"Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over his shoulder, \"jus' round this bend here.\" There was a loud \"Oooooh!\" The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. \"No more'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \"Right then — FORWARD!\" And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. \"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. \"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. \"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\" Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\n",
