      "THE BOY WHO LIVED\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that. \n",
      "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. \n",
      "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. \n",
      "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive. \n",
      "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. \n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something . . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \n",
      "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop- ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. \n",
      "He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \n",
      "\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard —\" \n",
      "\"— yes, their son, Harry —\" \n",
      "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. \n",
      "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It  might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her — if he'd had a sister like that . . . but all the same, those people in cloaks . . . \n",
      "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\" \n",
      "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. \n",
      "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. \n",
      "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw — and it didn't improve his mood — was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \n",
      "\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. \n",
      "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \n",
      "\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\" \n",
      "\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\" \n",
      "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . . Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er — Petunia, dear — you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\" \n",
      "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister. \n",
      "\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\" \n",
      "\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today . . .\" \n",
      "\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley. \n",
      "\"Well, I just thought . . . maybe . . . it was something to do with . . . you know . . . her crowd.\" \n",
      "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son — he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\" \n",
      "\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \n",
      "\"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?\" \n",
      "\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree.\" \n",
      "He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. \n",
      "Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did . . . if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn't think he could bear it. \n",
      "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn't affect them. . . . \n",
      "How very wrong he was. \n",
      "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. \n",
      "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. \n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\" \n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. \n",
      "\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\" \n",
      "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. \n",
      "\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked. \n",
      "\"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\" \"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall. \n",
      "\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \n",
      "\"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no — even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls . . . shooting stars. . . . Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\" \n",
      "\"You can't blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\" \n",
      "\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\" \n",
      "She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\" \n",
      "\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\" \n",
      "\"A what?\" \n",
      "\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.\" \"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone —\" \n",
      "\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You-Know-Who' nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.\" \n",
      "\"I know you haven't,\" said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\" \n",
      "\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\" \n",
      "\"Only because you're too — well — noble to use them.\" \n",
      "\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\" \n",
      "It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. \n",
      "\"What they're saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that they're — dead.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. \n",
      "\"Lily and James . . . I can't believe it . . . I didn't want to believe it . . . Oh, Albus . . .\" \n",
      "Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know . . . I know . . .\" he said heavily. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \"That's not all. They're saying he tried to kill the Potters' son, Harry. But — he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke — and that's why he's gone.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore nodded glumly. \n",
      "\"It's — it's true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he's done . . . all the people he's killed . . . he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\" \n",
      "\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have  made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?\" \n",
      "\"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now.\" \n",
      "\"You don't mean — you can't mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \"Dumbledore — you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\" \n",
      "\"It's the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter.\" \n",
      "\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous — a legend — I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!\" \n",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can't you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind,  swallowed, and then said, \"Yes — yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. \n",
      "\"Hagrid's bringing him.\" \n",
      "\"You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\" \n",
      "\"I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore. \n",
      "\"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to — what was that?\" \n",
      "A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. \n",
      "If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. \n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\" \n",
      "\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've got him, sir.\" \"No problems, were there?\" \n",
      "\"No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. \n",
      "\"Is that where — ?\" whispered Professor McGonagall. \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He'll have that scar forever.\" \n",
      "\"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\" \n",
      "\"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we'd better get this over with.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house. \n",
      "\"Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. \n",
      "\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you'll wake the Muggles!\" \n",
      "\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can't stand it — Lily an' James dead — an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles —\" \n",
      "\"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out. \n",
      "\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that's that. We've no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\" \n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I'd best get this bike away. G'night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.\" \n",
      "Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. \n",
      "\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. \n",
      "Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. \n",
      "\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . . He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THE VANISHING GLASS\n",
      "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \n",
      "\"Up! Get up! Now!\" \n",
      "Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \n",
      "\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. \n",
      "His aunt was back outside the door. \n",
      "\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \n",
      "\"Nearly,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\" \n",
      "Harry groaned. \n",
      "\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \n",
      "\"Nothing, nothing . . .\" \n",
      "Dudley's birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. \n",
      "When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he  wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. \n",
      "Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \n",
      "\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\" \n",
      "Don't ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \n",
      "\"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. \n",
      "About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put  together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. \n",
      "Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. \n",
      "Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \n",
      "\"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\" \n",
      "\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. \n",
      "Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\" \n",
      "Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty . . . thirty . . .\" \n",
      "\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \n",
      "\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair. \n",
      "At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \n",
      "\"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction. \n",
      "Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. \n",
      "\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \n",
      "\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \n",
      "\"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" \n",
      "The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. \n",
      "\"What about what's-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \n",
      "\"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). \n",
      "Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. \n",
      "\"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \n",
      "\"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \". . . and leave him in the car. . . .\" \n",
      "\"That cars new, he's not sitting in it alone. . . .\" \n",
      "Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying — it had been years since he'd really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \n",
      "\"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \n",
      "\"I . . . don't . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. \n",
      "Just then, the doorbell rang — \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. \n",
      "Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \n",
      "\"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" \n",
      "I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly . . .\" \n",
      "But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. \n",
      "The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. \n",
      "Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. \n",
      "Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. \n",
      "On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. \n",
      "But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. \n",
      "While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \n",
      "\". . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \n",
      "\"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\" \n",
      "Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don't,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" \n",
      "But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. \n",
      "It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. \n",
      "Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. \n",
      "Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. \n",
      "After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. \n",
      "Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \n",
      "\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. \n",
      "\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \n",
      "\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. \n",
      "Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. \n",
      "The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. \n",
      "It winked. \n",
      "Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. \n",
      "The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \n",
      "\"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" \n",
      "The snake nodded vigorously. \n",
      "\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. \n",
      "The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. \n",
      "Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \n",
      "\"Was it nice there?\" \n",
      "The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see — so you've never been to Brazil?\" \n",
      "As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\" \n",
      "Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \n",
      "\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. \n",
      "Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. \n",
      "As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.\" \n",
      "The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" \n",
      "The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. \n",
      "Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. \n",
      "He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He  couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. \n",
      "When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. \n",
      "At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n",
      "The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. \n",
      "\"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\" he told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\" \n",
      "\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said. \n",
      "One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn't as bad as usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years. \n",
      "That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. \n",
      "As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. \n",
      "There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. \n",
      "\"What's this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. \n",
      "\"Your new school uniform,\" she said. \n",
      "Harry looked in the bowl again. \n",
      "\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn't realize it had to be so wet.\" \n",
      "\"Don't be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished.\" \n",
      "Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. \n",
      "Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. \n",
      "They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. \n",
      "\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. \n",
      "\"Make Harry get it.\" \n",
      "\"Get the mail, Harry.\" \n",
      "\"Make Dudley get it.\" \n",
      "\"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\" Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. \n",
      "Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: \n",
      "Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey \n",
      "The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. \n",
      "Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. \n",
      "\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke. \n",
      "Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. \n",
      "\"Marge's ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk . . .\" \n",
      "\"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry's got something!\" \n",
      "Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. \n",
      "\"That's mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \n",
      "\"Who'd be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. \n",
      "\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped. \n",
      "Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \n",
      "\"Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!\" \n",
      "They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. \n",
      "\"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. \n",
      "\"I want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it's mine.\" \n",
      "\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. \n",
      "Harry didn't move. \n",
      "\"I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted. \"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley. \n",
      "\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. \n",
      "\"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?\" \n",
      "\"Watching — spying — might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \n",
      "\"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't want —\" \n",
      "Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. \n",
      "\"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer. . . . Yes, that's best . . . we won't do anything. . . .\" \n",
      "\"But —\" \n",
      "\"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\" \n",
      "That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. \n",
      "\"Where's my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who's writing to me?\" \n",
      "\"No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly. \"I have burned it.\" \n",
      "\"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\" \n",
      "\"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. \n",
      "\"Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking . . . you're really getting a bit big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.\" \n",
      "\"Why?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Don't ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs, now.\" \n",
      "The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched. \n",
      "From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \"I don't want him in there . . . I need that room . . . make him get out. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. \n",
      "Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. \n",
      "When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —' \" \n",
      "With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand. \n",
      "\"Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley — go — just go.\" \n",
      "Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan. \n",
      "The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. \n",
      "He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door — \n",
      "\"AAAAARRRGH!\" \n",
      "Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive! \n",
      "Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. \n",
      "\"I want —\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didn't go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. \n",
      "\"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can't deliver them they'll just give up.\" \n",
      "\"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. \n",
      "On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" as he worked, and jumped at small noises. \n",
      "On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. \n",
      "\"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in amazement. \n",
      "On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \n",
      "\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today —\" \n",
      "Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one — \n",
      "\"Out! OUT!\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. \n",
      "\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \"I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\" \n",
      "He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. \n",
      "They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake 'em off . . . shake 'em off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this. \n",
      "They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering. . . . \n",
      "They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. \n",
      "\" 'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk.\" \n",
      "She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: \n",
      "Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth \n",
      "Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. \n",
      "\"I'll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. \n",
      "\"Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. \n",
      "\"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. \n",
      "It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. \n",
      "\"It's Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto's on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\" \n",
      "Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every day. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought. \n",
      "\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\" \n",
      "It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. \n",
      "\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \"And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\" \n",
      "A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \n",
      "\"I've already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\" \n",
      "It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. \n",
      "The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \n",
      "\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully. \n",
      "He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all. \n",
      "As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce  \n",
      "wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. \n",
      "The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. \n",
      "Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow. \n",
      "Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? \n",
      "One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . twenty . . . ten . . . nine — maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . . \n",
      "BOOM. \n",
      "The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n",
      "BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where's the cannon?\" he said stupidly. There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands — now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. \"Who's there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you — I'm armed!\" There was a pause. Then — SMASH! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. \n",
      "\"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy journey. . . .\" \n",
      "He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. \n",
      "\"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger. \n",
      "Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \n",
      "\"An' here's Harry!\" said the giant. \n",
      "Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \n",
      "\"Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh've got yer mom's eyes.\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \n",
      "\"I demand that you leave at once, sir!\" he said. \"You are breaking and entering!\" \n",
      "\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. \n",
      "\"Anyway — Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right.\" \n",
      "From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly  squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. \n",
      "Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\" \n",
      "The giant chuckled. \n",
      "\"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm. \n",
      "\"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.\" \n",
      "His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath. \n",
      "The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \"Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\" \n",
      "The giant chuckled darkly. \"Yer great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don' worry.\" \n",
      "He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \"I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.\" \n",
      "The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \n",
      "\"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh'll know all about Hog-warts, o' course.\" \n",
      "\"Er — no,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Hagrid looked shocked. \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly. \n",
      "\"Sorry?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \"It's them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?\" \n",
      "\"All what?\" asked Harry. \n",
      "\"ALL WHAT?\" Hagrid thundered. \"Now wait jus' one second!\" \n",
      "He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. \n",
      "\"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin' abou' — about ANYTHING?\" \n",
      "Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad. \n",
      "\"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\" But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \"About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents' world.\" \n",
      "\"What world?\" \n",
      "Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \n",
      "\"DURSLEY!\" he boomed. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \"Mimblewimble.\" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. \n",
      "\"But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they're famous. You're famous.\" \n",
      "\"What? My — my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?\" \n",
      "\"Yeh don' know . . . yeh don' know . . .\" Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. \n",
      "\"Yeh don' know what yeh are?\" he said finally. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. \n",
      "\"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\" \n",
      "A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. \n",
      "\"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An' you've kept it from him all these years?\" \n",
      "\"Kept what from me?\" said Harry eagerly. \n",
      "\"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. \n",
      "Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \n",
      "\"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry — yer a wizard.\" \n",
      "There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. \"I'm a what?\" gasped Harry. \n",
      "\"A wizard, o' course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \"an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.\" \n",
      "Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: \n",
      "HOGWARTS SCHOOL \n",
      "of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY \n",
      "Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore \n",
      "(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, \n",
      "Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards ) \n",
      "Dear Mr. Potter, \n",
      "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. \n",
      "Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, \n",
      "Minerva McGonagall, \n",
      "Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does it mean, they await my owl?\" \n",
      "\"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: \n",
      "Dear Professor Dumbledore, \n",
      "Given Harry his letter. \n",
      "Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. \n",
      "Weather's horrible. Hope you're well. \n",
      "Hagrid \n",
      "Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. \n",
      "Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. \n",
      "\"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. \n",
      "\"He's not going,\" he said. \n",
      "Hagrid grunted. \n",
      "\"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said. \n",
      "\"A what?\" said Harry, interested. \"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it's what we call nonmagic folk like them. An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\" \n",
      "\"We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\" \n",
      "\"You knew?\" said Harry. \"You knew I'm a — a wizard?\" \n",
      "\"Knew!\" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \"Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\" \n",
      "She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. \n",
      "\"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\" \n",
      "Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\" \n",
      "\"CAR CRASH!\" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \"How could a car crash kill Lily an' James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\" \"But why? What happened?\" Harry asked urgently. \n",
      "The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious. \n",
      "\"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right person ter tell yeh — but someone's gotta — yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin'.\" \n",
      "He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \n",
      "\"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it. . . .\" \n",
      "He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \"It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows —\" \n",
      "\"Who?\" \n",
      "\"Well — I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does.\" \n",
      "\"Why not?\" \n",
      "\"Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . .\" \n",
      "Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. \n",
      "\"Could you write it down?\" Harry suggested. \n",
      "\"Nah — can't spell it. All right — Voldemort.\" Hagrid shuddered. \"Don' make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too — some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up to him — an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway. \n",
      "\"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the mys-t'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before . . . probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the Dark Side. \n",
      "\"Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em . . . maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an' — an' —\" \n",
      "Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he said. \"But it's that sad — knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find — anyway . . . \n",
      "\"You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then — an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even — but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an' you was only a baby, an' you lived.\" \n",
      "Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind. As Hagrid's story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. \n",
      "Hagrid was watching him sadly. \n",
      "\"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . .\" \n",
      "\"Load of old tosh,\" said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Ha-grid and his fists were clenched. \n",
      "\"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end —\" \n",
      "But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \"I'm warning you, Dursley — I'm warning you — one more word . . .\" \n",
      "In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. \"That's better,\" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. \n",
      "Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. \n",
      "\"But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?\" \n",
      "\"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see . . . he was gettin' more an' more powerful — why'd he go? \n",
      "\"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don' reckon they could've done if he was comin' back. \n",
      "\"Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin' about you stumped him, all right.\" \n",
      "Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? \"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I don't think I can be a wizard.\" \n",
      "To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \n",
      "\"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\" \n",
      "Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry . . . chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach . . . dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him? \n",
      "Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. \n",
      "\"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight. \n",
      "\"Haven't I told you he's not going?\" he hissed. \"He's going to Stonewall High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —\" \n",
      "\"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him,\" growled Hagrid. \"Stop Lily an' James Potter's son goin' ter Hog-warts! Yer mad. His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled—\" \"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\" yelled Uncle Vernon. \n",
      "But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \"NEVER —\" he thundered, \"— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!\" \n",
      "He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. \n",
      "Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. \n",
      "\"Shouldn'ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn't work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do.\" \n",
      "He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. \n",
      "\"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he said. \"I'm — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff — one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job —\" \n",
      "\"Why aren't you supposed to do magic?\" asked Harry. \n",
      "\"Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\" \"Why were you expelled?\" \n",
      "\"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow,\" said Hagrid loudly. \"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that.\" \n",
      "He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. \n",
      "\"You can kip under that,\" he said. \"Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "DIAGON ALLEY\n",
      "Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. \"It was a dream,\" he told himself firmly. \"I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard.\" There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap. Tap. \"All right,\" Harry mumbled, \"I'm getting up.\" He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat. \n",
      "\"Don't do that.\" \n",
      "Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. \n",
      "\"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There's an owl —\" \n",
      "\"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \n",
      "\"What?\" \n",
      "\"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets.\" \n",
      "Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags . . . finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \n",
      "\"Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily. \n",
      "\"Knuts?\" \n",
      "\"The little bronze ones.\" \n",
      "Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. \n",
      "Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \n",
      "\"Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school.\" \n",
      "Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. \"Um — Hagrid?\" \n",
      "\"Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. \n",
      "\"I haven't got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night . . . he won't pay for me to go and learn magic.\" \n",
      "\"Don't worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \"D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?\" \n",
      "\"But if their house was destroyed —\" \n",
      "\"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold — an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither.\" \n",
      "\"Wizards have banks?\" \n",
      "\"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\" \n",
      "Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \n",
      "\"Goblins?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah — so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe — 'cept maybe Hog-warts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \"He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you — gettin' things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see. \n",
      "\"Got everythin'? Come on, then.\" \n",
      "Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. \n",
      "\"How did you get here?\" Harry asked, looking around for another boat. \"Flew,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "\"Flew?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah — but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh.\" \n",
      "They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. \n",
      "\"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \"If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?\" \n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. \n",
      "\"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\" Harry asked. \n",
      "\"Spells — enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \"They say there's dragons guardin' the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\" \n",
      "Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions in his life. \n",
      "\"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered, turning the page. \n",
      "\"There's a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop himself. \n",
      "\" 'Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o' course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice.\" \n",
      "\"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\" \n",
      "\"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country.\" \n",
      "\"Why?\" \n",
      "\"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we're best left alone.\" \n",
      "At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. \n",
      "Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Ha-grid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\" \n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\" \n",
      "\"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I'd like a dragon.\" \n",
      "\"You'd like one?\" \n",
      "\"Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.\" \n",
      "They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand \"Muggle money,\" as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. \n",
      "People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. \n",
      "\"Still got yer letter, Harry?\" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \n",
      "\"Good,\" said Hagrid. \"There's a list there of everything yeh need.\" \n",
      "Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night before, and read: \n",
      "HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY \n",
      "uniform \n",
      "First-year students will require: \n",
      "1.\n",
      " Three sets of plain work robes (black) \n",
      "2. \n",

      "\"Can we buy all this in London?\" Harry wondered aloud. \"If yeh know where to go,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. \n",
      "\"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. \n",
      "Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry  had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him. \n",
      "\"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron. It's a famous place.\" \n",
      "It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Ha-grid had steered him inside. \n",
      "For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\" \"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle. \n",
      "\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this — can this be — ?\" \n",
      "The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. \n",
      "\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter . . . what an honor.\" \n",
      "He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \n",
      "\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\" \n",
      "Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. \n",
      "Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. \n",
      "\"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last.\" \n",
      "\"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud.\" \n",
      "\"Always wanted to shake your hand — I'm all of a flutter.\" \n",
      "\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle.\" \n",
      "\"I've seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\" \n",
      "\"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. \n",
      "A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. \n",
      "\"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, \"c-can't t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\" \n",
      "\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\" \n",
      "\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought. \n",
      "But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. \n",
      "\"Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\" \n",
      "Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. \n",
      "Hagrid grinned at Harry. \n",
      "\"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh — mind you, he's usually tremblin'.\" \n",
      "\"Is he always that nervous?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience. . . . They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject — now, where's me umbrella?\" \n",
      "Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. \n",
      "\"Three up . . . two across . . .\" he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\" \n",
      "He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. \n",
      "The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Ha-grid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. \n",
      "\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\" \n",
      "He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. \n",
      "The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \n",
      "\"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first.\" \n",
      "Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they're mad. \n",
      "A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon. . . . \n",
      "\"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was — \n",
      "\"Yeah, that's a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: \n",
      "Enter, stranger, but take heed \n",
      "Of what awaits the sin of greed, \n",
      "For those who take, but do not earn, \n",
      "Must pay most dearly in their turn. \n",
      "So if you seek beneath our floors \n",
      "A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware \n",
      "Of finding more than treasure there. \n",
      "\"Like I said, yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. \n",
      "\"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe.\" \n",
      "\"You have his key, sir?\" \n",
      "\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. \n",
      "\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. \n",
      "The goblin looked at it closely. \n",
      "\"That seems to be in order.\" \n",
      "\"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It's about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\" \n",
      "The goblin read the letter carefully. \n",
      "\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\" \n",
      "Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. \n",
      "\"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry asked. \n",
      "\"Can't tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that.\" \n",
      "Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off. \n",
      "At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering. \n",
      "Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \n",
      "\"I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\" \n",
      "\"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick.\" He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. \n",
      "Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \n",
      "\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid. \n",
      "All Harry's — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. \n",
      "Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \n",
      "\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\" \n",
      "\"One speed only,\" said Griphook. \n",
      "They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Ha-grid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. \n",
      "Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \n",
      "\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. \"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook. \n",
      "\"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?\" Harry asked. \n",
      "\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. \n",
      "Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. \n",
      "\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had. \n",
      "\"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous. \n",
      "Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. \"Hogwarts, dear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\" \n",
      "In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. \n",
      "\"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \"Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow.\" \n",
      "Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \n",
      "\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on. \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Play Quidditch at all?\" \n",
      "\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. \n",
      "\"I do — Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you'll be in yet?\" \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \n",
      "\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. \n",
      "\"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in. \n",
      "\"That's Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't. \"He works at Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?\" \n",
      "\"He's the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. \n",
      "\"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\" \n",
      "\"I think he's brilliant,\" said Harry coldly. \n",
      "\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where are your parents?\" \n",
      "\"They're dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy. \n",
      "\"Oh, sorry,\" said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were our kind, weren't they?\" \n",
      "\"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean.\" \n",
      "\"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname, anyway?\" \n",
      "But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That's  you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. \n",
      "\"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy. \n",
      "Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). \n",
      "\"What's up?\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what's Quidditch?\" \n",
      "\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know — not knowin' about Quidditch!\" \n",
      "\"Don't make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin's. \n",
      "\"— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in —\" \n",
      "\"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were — he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in 'em in a long line o' Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\" \n",
      "\"So what is Quidditch?\" \n",
      "\"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.\" \"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\" \n",
      "\"School Houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but —\" \n",
      "\"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff,\" said Harry gloomily. \n",
      "\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\" \n",
      "\"Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\" \n",
      "\"Years an' years ago,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. \n",
      "\"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\" \n",
      "\"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\" \n",
      "Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says pewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up  for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). \n",
      "Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again. \n",
      "\"Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday present.\" \n",
      "Harry felt himself go red. \n",
      "\"You don't have to —\" \n",
      "\"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at — an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'.\" \n",
      "Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \n",
      "\"Don' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\" \n",
      "A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 b.c. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. \n",
      "A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. \n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. \n",
      "An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. \n",
      "\"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly. \n",
      "\"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\" It wasn't a question. \"You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\" \n",
      "Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \n",
      "\"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\" Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. \n",
      "\"And that's where . . .\" \n",
      "Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger. \n",
      "\"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly. \"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands . . . well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do. . . .\" \n",
      "He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid. \n",
      "\"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?\" \n",
      "\"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "\"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. \n",
      "\"Er — yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \"I've still got the pieces, though,\" he added brightly. \n",
      "\"But you don't use them?\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply. \n",
      "\"Oh, no, sir,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \n",
      "\"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.\" He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \"Which is your wand arm?\" \n",
      "\"Er — well, I'm right-handed,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Hold out your arm. That's it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander  wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand.\" \n",
      "Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. \n",
      "\"That will do,\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.\" \n",
      "Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. \n",
      "\"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches.  Quite whippy. Try —\" \n",
      "Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. \n",
      "\"No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\" \n",
      "Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. \n",
      "\"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\" Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well . . . how curious . . . how very curious . . .\" \n",
      "He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \"Curious . . . curious . . .\" \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what's curious?\" \n",
      "Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \n",
      "\"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.\" \n",
      "Harry swallowed. \n",
      "\"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.\" \n",
      "Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. \n",
      "The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Ha-grid tapped him on the shoulder. \n",
      "\"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said. \n",
      "He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. \n",
      "\"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. \n",
      "\"Everyone thinks I'm special,\" he said at last. \"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander . . . but I don't know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.\" \n",
      "Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \n",
      "\"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it's hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, 'smatter of fact.\" Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. \n",
      "\"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,\" he said. \"First o' September — King's Cross — it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me. . . . See yeh soon, Harry.\" \n",
      "The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Ha-grid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\n",
      "Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn't speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off  \n",
      "another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. \n",
      "On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. \n",
      "\"Er — Uncle Vernon?\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \n",
      "\"Er — I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "Uncle Vernon grunted again. \n",
      "\"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\" \n",
      "Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \n",
      "\"Thank you.\" \n",
      "He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. \n",
      "\"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\" \n",
      "Harry didn't say anything. \n",
      "\"Where is this school, anyway?\" \n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. \n",
      "\"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock,\" he read. \n",
      "His aunt and uncle stared. \n",
      "\"Platform what?\" \n",
      "\"Nine and three-quarters.\" \"Don't talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and three-quarters.\" \n",
      "\"It's on my ticket.\" \n",
      "\"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see. You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.\" \n",
      "\"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. \n",
      "\"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\" \n",
      "Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes — he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. \n",
      "They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \n",
      "\"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?\" \n",
      "He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. \n",
      "\"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone. \n",
      "He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hog-warts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. \n",
      "Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten. \n",
      "At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. \n",
      "\"— packed with Muggles, of course —\" Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him — and they had an owl. \n",
      "Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. \n",
      "\"Now, what's the platform number?\" said the boys' mother. \n",
      "\"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, \"Mom, can't I go . . .\" \n",
      "\"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\" \n",
      "What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. \n",
      "\"Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said. \n",
      "\"I'm not Fred, I'm George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can't you tell I'm George?\" \n",
      "\"Sorry, George, dear.\" \n",
      "\"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it? \n",
      "Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier — he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere. \n",
      "There was nothing else for it. \n",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman. \n",
      "\"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too.\" \n",
      "She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is — the thing is, I don't know how to —\" \n",
      "\"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded. \n",
      "\"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\" \n",
      "\"Er — okay,\" said Harry. \n",
      "He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. \n",
      "He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn't be able to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — \n",
      "It didn't come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes. \n",
      "A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway  where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it. He had done it. \n",
      "Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. \n",
      "The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I've lost my toad again.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh. \n",
      "A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. \n",
      "\"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\" \n",
      "The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. \n",
      "Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \n",
      "\"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier. \n",
      "\"Yes, please,\" Harry panted. \n",
      "\"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!\" \n",
      "With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. \n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. \n",
      "\"What's that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar. \n",
      "\"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you — ?\" \n",
      "\"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren't you?\" he added to Harry. \n",
      "\"What?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" chorused the twins. \n",
      "\"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\" \n",
      "The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door. \n",
      "\"Fred? George? Are you there?\" \n",
      "\"Coming, Mom.\" \n",
      "With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. \n",
      "Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. \n",
      "\"Ron, you've got something on your nose.\" \n",
      "The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. \n",
      "\"Mom — geroff.\" He wriggled free. \n",
      "\"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the twins. \n",
      "\"Shut up,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Where's Percy?\" said their mother. \n",
      "\"He's coming now.\" \n",
      "The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it. \n",
      "\"Can't stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves —\" \n",
      "\"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\" \n",
      "\"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the other twin. \"Once —\" \n",
      "\"Or twice —\" \n",
      "\"A minute —\" \n",
      "\"All summer —\" \n",
      "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect. \n",
      "\"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins. \n",
      "\"Because he's a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.\" \n",
      "She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. \n",
      "\"Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've — you've blown up a toilet or —\" \n",
      "\"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.\" \n",
      "\"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\" \n",
      "\"It's not funny. And look after Ron.\" \n",
      "\"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\" \n",
      "\"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. \n",
      "\"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\" \n",
      "Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking. \n",
      "\"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\" \n",
      "\"Who?\" \n",
      "\"Harry Potter!\" \n",
      "Harry heard the little girl's voice. \n",
      "\"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, oh please. . . .\" \n",
      "\"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\" \n",
      "\"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there — like lightning.\" \n",
      "\"Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\" \n",
      "\"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\" \n",
      "Their mother suddenly became very stern. \n",
      "\"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\" \n",
      "\"All right, keep your hair on.\" \n",
      "A whistle sounded. \n",
      "\"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. \n",
      "\"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls.\" \n",
      "\"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\" \n",
      "\"George!\" \n",
      "\"Only joking, Mom.\" \n",
      "The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving  and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. \n",
      "Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn't know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. \n",
      "The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. \n",
      "\"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \"Everywhere else is full.\" \n",
      "Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. \n",
      "\"Hey, Ron.\" \n",
      "The twins were back. \n",
      "\"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there.\" \n",
      "\"Right,\" mumbled Ron. \n",
      "\"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\" \n",
      "\"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. \n",
      "\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out. \n",
      "Harry nodded. \n",
      "\"Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got — you know . . .\" \n",
      "He pointed at Harry's forehead. \n",
      "Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. \n",
      "\"So that's where You-Know-Who — ?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can't remember it.\" \n",
      "\"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly. \n",
      "\"Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\" \n",
      "\"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. \n",
      "\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. \n",
      "\"Er — yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.\" \n",
      "\"So you must know loads of magic already.\" \n",
      "The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. \n",
      "\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\" \n",
      "\"Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.\" \n",
      "\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.\" \n",
      "Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. \n",
      "\"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff— I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\" \n",
      "Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. \n",
      "Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. \n",
      "\". . . and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort —\" \n",
      "Ron gasped. \n",
      "\"What?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"You said You-Know-Who's name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I'd have thought you, of all people —\" \n",
      "\"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, \"I just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to learn. . . . I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I'm the worst in the class.\" \n",
      "\"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\" \n",
      "While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and \n",
      "sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. \n",
      "Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears?\" \n",
      "Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. \n",
      "He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. \n",
      "Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \n",
      "\"Hungry, are you?\" \n",
      "\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. \n",
      "Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She always forgets I don't like corned beef.\" \n",
      "\"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on —\" \n",
      "\"You don't want this, it's all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn't got much time,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\" \"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \n",
      "\"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \"They're not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. \n",
      "\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.\" \n",
      "\"What?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know — Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\" \n",
      "Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man's face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. \n",
      "\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —\" \n",
      "Harry turned over his card and read: \n",
      "ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \n",
      "currently headmaster of hogwarts \n",
      "Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, \n",
      "Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the  \n",
      "Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. \n",
      "Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that \n",
      "Dumbledore's face had disappeared. \n",
      "\"He's gone!\" \n",
      "\"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He'll be back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her . . . do you want it? You can start collecting.\" \n",
      "Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. \n",
      "\"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\" \n",
      "\"Do they? What, they don't move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed. \"Weird!\" \n",
      "Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. \n",
      "\"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\" \n",
      "Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. \n",
      "\"Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.\" \n",
      "They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper. \n",
      "The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. \n",
      "There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful. \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\" \n",
      "When they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\" \n",
      "\"He'll turn up,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him . . .\" \n",
      "He left. \n",
      "\"Don't know why he's so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk.\" \n",
      "The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap. \n",
      "\"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look . . .\" \n",
      "He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. \n",
      "\"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway —\" \n",
      "He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. \n",
      "\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. \n",
      "\"We've already told him we haven't seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. \n",
      "\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.\" \n",
      "She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \n",
      "\"Er — all right.\" \n",
      "He cleared his throat. \n",
      "\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\" \n",
      "He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. \n",
      "\"Are you sure that's a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard — I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it  will be enough — I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are \n",
      "you?\" \n",
      "She said all this very fast. \n",
      "Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either. \n",
      "\"I'm Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\" \n",
      "\"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed. \n",
      "\"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad. . . . Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.\" \n",
      "And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \n",
      "\"Whatever House I'm in, I hope she's not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\" \n",
      "\"What House are your brothers in?\" asked Harry. \n",
      "\"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\" \n",
      "\"That's the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. \n",
      "\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,\" said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off Houses. \"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?\" \n",
      "Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school. \n",
      "\"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.\" \n",
      "Harry stared. \n",
      "\"Really? What happened to them?\" \n",
      "\"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it.\" \n",
      "Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying. \n",
      "\"What's your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked. \n",
      "\"Er — I don't know any,\" Harry confessed. \n",
      "\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world —\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. \n",
      "Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley. \n",
      "\"Is it true?\" he said. \"They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. \n",
      "\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \"And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\" \n",
      "Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \n",
      "\"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\" \n",
      "He turned back to Harry. \"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\" \n",
      "He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it. \n",
      "\"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly. \n",
      "Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. \n",
      "\"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.\" \n",
      "Both Harry and Ron stood up. \n",
      "\"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair. \n",
      "\"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered. \n",
      "\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. \n",
      "\"But we don't feel like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\" \n",
      "Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. \n",
      "Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. \n",
      "\"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. \n",
      "\"I think he's been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \"No — I don't believe it — he's gone back to \n",
      "sleep.\" \n",
      "And so he had. \n",
      "\"You've met Malfoy before?\" \n",
      "Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. \n",
      "\"I've heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to Hermione. \"Can we help you with something?\" \n",
      "\"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!\" \n",
      "\"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would you mind leaving while we change?\" \n",
      "\"All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \"And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\" \n",
      "Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. \n",
      "He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. \n",
      "A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hog- \n",
      "warts in five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\" \n",
      "Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. \n",
      "The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?\" \n",
      "Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \n",
      "\"C'mon, follow me — any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!\" \n",
      "Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. \n",
      "\"Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over his shoulder, \"jus' round this bend here.\" \n",
      "There was a loud \"Oooooh!\" \n",
      "The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. \n",
      "\"No more'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \"Right then — FORWARD!\" \n",
      "And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \n",
      "\"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. \n",
      "\"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. \n",
      "\"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. \n",
      "They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. \n",
      "\"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\" \n",
      "Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE SORTING HAT\n",
      "The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross. \"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid. \"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\" She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. \n",
      "\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room. \n",
      "\"The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hog-warts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. \n",
      "\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\" \n",
      "Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. \n",
      "\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor Mc-Gonagall. \"Please wait quietly.\" \n",
      "She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \n",
      "\"How exactly do they sort us into Houses?\" he asked Ron. \"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\" \n",
      "Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. \n",
      "Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed. \n",
      "\"What the — ?\" \n",
      "He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —\" \n",
      "\"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?\" \n",
      "A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. Nobody answered. \n",
      "\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\" \n",
      "A few people nodded mutely. \n",
      "\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old House, you know.\" \n",
      "\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. \n",
      "\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\" \n",
      "Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. \n",
      "Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \"It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\" \n",
      "It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens. \n",
      "Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house. \n",
      "Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing: \n",
      "\"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, \n",
      "But don't judge on what you see, \n",
      "I'll eat myself if you can find \n",
      "A smarter hat than me. \n",
      "You can keep your bowlers black, \n",
      "Your top hats sleek and tall, \n",
      "For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat \n",
      "And I can cap them all. \n",
      "There's nothing hidden in your head \n",
      "The Sorting Hat can't see, \n",
      "So try me on and I will tell you \n",
      "Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, \n",
      "Where dwell the brave at heart, \n",
      "Their daring, nerve, and chivalry \n",
      "Set Gryffindors apart; \n",
      "You might belong in Hufflepuff, \n",
      "Where they are just and loyal, \n",
      "Those patient Hufflepuffs are true \n",
      "And unafraid of toil; \n",
      "Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, \n",
      "If you've a ready mind, \n",
      "Where those of wit and learning, \n",
      "Will always find their kind; \n",
      "Or perhaps in Slytherin \n",
      "You'll make your real friends, \n",
      "Those cunning folk use any means \n",
      "To achieve their ends. \n",
      "So put me on! Don't be afraid! \n",
      "And don't get in a flap! \n",
      "You're in safe hands (though I have none) \n",
      "For I'm a Thinking Cap!\" \n",
      "The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. \n",
      "\"So we've just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\" \n",
      "Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a  lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. \n",
      "\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\" \n",
      "A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment's pause — \n",
      "\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat. \n",
      "The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. \n",
      "\"Bones, Susan!\" \n",
      "\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \n",
      "\"Boot, Terry!\" \n",
      "\"RAVENCLAW!\" \n",
      "The table second from the left clapped this time; several Raven-claws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. \n",
      "\"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling. \n",
      "\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. \n",
      "\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\" \n",
      "\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" \n",
      "Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. \n",
      "\"Granger, Hermione!\" \n",
      "Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \n",
      "\"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned. \n",
      "A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train? \n",
      "When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\" \n",
      "Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\" Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. \n",
      "There weren't many people left now. \n",
      "\"Moon\" . . . , \"Nott\" . . . , \"Parkinson\" . . . , then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" . . . , then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" . . . , and then, at last — \n",
      "\"Potter, Harry!\" \n",
      "As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. \n",
      "\"Potter, did she say?\" \n",
      "\"The Harry Potter?\" \n",
      "The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. \n",
      "\"Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?\" \n",
      "Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. \n",
      "\"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you're sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!\" \n",
      "Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the  Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. \n",
      "He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. \n",
      "And now there were only four people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\" \n",
      "Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. \n",
      "\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. \n",
      "Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. \n",
      "\"Welcome!\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \n",
      "\"Thank you!\" \n",
      "He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. \n",
      "\"Is he — a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly. \n",
      "\"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\" \n",
      "Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. \n",
      "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. \n",
      "\"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. \n",
      "\"Can't you — ?\" \n",
      "\"I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\" \n",
      "\"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you — you're Nearly Headless Nick!\" \n",
      "\"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —\" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. \n",
      "\"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\" \n",
      "Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted. \n",
      "\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So — new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable — he's the Slytherin ghost.\" \n",
      "Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements. \n",
      "\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest. \n",
      "\"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. \n",
      "When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as be- fore. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate &eacute;clairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding . . . \n",
      "As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. \n",
      "\"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\" \n",
      "The others laughed. \n",
      "\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\" \n",
      "On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult —\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —\"). \n",
      "Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. \n",
      "It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead. \n",
      "\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head. \n",
      "\"What is it?\" asked Percy. \n",
      "\"N-nothing.\" \n",
      "The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look — a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all. \n",
      "\"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy. \n",
      "\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to — everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\" \n",
      "Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again. \n",
      "At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \n",
      "\"Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. \n",
      "\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \n",
      "\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch. \n",
      "\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\" \n",
      "Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \n",
      "\"He's not serious?\" he muttered to Percy. \n",
      "\"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere — the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\" \n",
      "\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed. \n",
      "Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. \n",
      "\"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\" And the school bellowed: \n",
      "\"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, \n",
      "Teach us something please, \n",
      "Whether we be old and bald \n",
      "Or young with scabby knees, \n",
      "Our heads could do with filling \n",
      "With some interesting stuff, \n",
      "For now they're bare and full of air, \n",
      "Dead flies and bits of fluff, \n",
      "So teach us things worth knowing, \n",
      "Bring back what we've forgot, \n",
      "Just do your best, we'll do the rest, \n",
      "And learn until our brains all rot.\" \n",
      "Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \n",
      "\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\" \n",
      "The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more  staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. \n",
      "A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. \n",
      "\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves — show yourself.\" \n",
      "A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. \n",
      "\"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\" \n",
      "There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \n",
      "\"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\" \n",
      "He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \n",
      "\"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy. \n",
      "Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \n",
      "\"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\" \n",
      "At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \n",
      "\"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. \n",
      "Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. \n",
      "\"Great food, isn't it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets.\" \n",
      "Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. \n",
      "Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. \n",
      "He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE POTIONS MASTER\n",
      "There, look.\" \"Where?\" \"Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\" \"Wearing the glasses?\" \"Did you see his face?\" \"Did you see his scar?\" Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. \n",
      "The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\" \n",
      "Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. \n",
      "Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two  seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick. \n",
      "And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. \n",
      "They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. \n",
      "Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. \n",
      "Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. \"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\" \n",
      "Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. \n",
      "The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. \n",
      "Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards.  There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start. \n",
      "Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. \n",
      "\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. \n",
      "\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we'll be able to see if it's true.\" \n",
      "\"Wish McGonagall favored us,\" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. \n",
      "Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. \n",
      "Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: \n",
      "Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an \n",
      "answer back with Hedwig. \n",
      "Hagrid \n",
      "Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. \n",
      "It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. \n",
      "At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry — he hated him. \n",
      "Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. \n",
      "Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name. \n",
      "\"Ah, yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.\" \n",
      "Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. \n",
      "\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had  the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\" \n",
      "More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead. \n",
      "\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\" \n",
      "Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air. \n",
      "\"I don't know, sir,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Snape's lips curled into a sneer. \n",
      "\"Tut, tut — fame clearly isn't everything.\" \n",
      "He ignored Hermione's hand. \n",
      "\"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\" \n",
      "Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. \n",
      "\"I don't know, sir.\" \"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" \n",
      "Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? \n",
      "Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand. \n",
      "\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfs-bane?\" \n",
      "At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. \n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?\" \n",
      "A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. \n",
      "\"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?\" \n",
      "There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\" \n",
      "Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. \n",
      "\"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\" \n",
      "Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. \n",
      "\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. \n",
      "\"You — Potter — why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.\" \n",
      "This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. \n",
      "\"Don't push it,\" he muttered, \"I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.\" \n",
      "As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\" \n",
      "At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. \n",
      "When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang — back.\" \n",
      "Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. \n",
      "\"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\" \n",
      "He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. \n",
      "There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \n",
      "\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. \n",
      "\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. \n",
      "\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. \"I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\" \n",
      "The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \"that old git'' \n",
      "\"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.\" \n",
      "Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. \n",
      "\"But he seemed to really hate me.\" \n",
      "\"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\" \n",
      "Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet \n",
      "his eyes when he said that. \"How's yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot — great with animals.\" \n",
      "Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: \n",
      "GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST \n",
      "Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. \n",
      "Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. \n",
      "\"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. \n",
      "Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date. \n",
      "\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!\" \n",
      "There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? \n",
      "As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n",
      "Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\" He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. \"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk.\" Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. \n",
      "Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. \n",
      "Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. \n",
      "Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl  was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. \n",
      "A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. \n",
      "\"It's a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things — this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh . . .\" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \". . . you've forgotten something . . .\" \n",
      "Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. \n",
      "Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. \n",
      "\"What's going on?\" \n",
      "\"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor.\" \n",
      "Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. \n",
      "\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. \n",
      "At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a  smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. \n",
      "The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. \n",
      "Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \n",
      "\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\" \n",
      "Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. \n",
      "\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say 'Up!' \" \n",
      "\"UP!\" everyone shouted. \n",
      "Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. \n",
      "Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years. \n",
      "\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few  feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle — three — two —\" \n",
      "But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips. \n",
      "\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and — \n",
      "WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. \n",
      "Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \n",
      "\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy — it's all right, up you get.\" \n",
      "She turned to the rest of the class. \n",
      "\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.\" \n",
      "Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. \n",
      "No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. \n",
      "\"Did you see his face, the great lump?\" \n",
      "The other Slytherins joined in. \n",
      "\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil. \"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\" \n",
      "\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \"It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.\" \n",
      "The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. \n",
      "\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. \n",
      "Malfoy smiled nastily. \n",
      "\"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?\" \n",
      "\"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\" \n",
      "Harry grabbed his broom. \n",
      "\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move — you'll get us all into trouble.\" \n",
      "Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. \n",
      "He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. \"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I'll knock you off that broom!\" \n",
      "\"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. \n",
      "Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping. \n",
      "\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called. \n",
      "The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. \n",
      "\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. \n",
      "Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he stretched out his hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. \n",
      "\"HARRY POTTER!\" \n",
      "His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. \n",
      "\"Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \"— how dare you — might have broken your neck —\" \n",
      "\"It wasn't his fault, Professor —\" \"Be quiet, Miss Patil —\" \n",
      "\"But Malfoy —\" \n",
      "\"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\" \n",
      "Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? \n",
      "Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside. \n",
      "\"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\" \n",
      "Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? \n",
      "But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick's class looking confused. \"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. \n",
      "\"In here.\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard. \n",
      "\"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. \n",
      "\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I've found you a Seeker.\" \n",
      "Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight. \n",
      "\"Are you serious, Professor?\" \n",
      "\"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy's a natural. I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\" \n",
      "Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. \n",
      "\"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it.\" \n",
      "Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. \n",
      "\"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly. \n",
      "\"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained. \n",
      "\"He's just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking  around Harry and staring at him. \"Light — speedy — we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.\" \n",
      "\"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. . . .\" \n",
      "Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. \n",
      "\"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\" \n",
      "Then she suddenly smiled. \n",
      "\"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\" \n",
      "\"You're joking.\" \n",
      "It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it. \n",
      "\"Seeker?\" he said. \"But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about —\" \n",
      "\"— a century,\" said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \"Wood told me.\" \n",
      "Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. \n",
      "\"I start training next week,\" said Harry. \"Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\" \n",
      "Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over. \"Well done,\" said George in a low voice. \"Wood told us. We're on the team too — Beaters.\" \n",
      "\"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,\" said Fred. \"We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\" \n",
      "\"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school.\" \n",
      "\"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\" \n",
      "Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. \n",
      "\"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\" \n",
      "\"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl. \n",
      "\"I'd take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy. \"Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only — no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?\" \n",
      "\"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around. \"I'm his second, who's yours?\" \n",
      "Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. \n",
      "\"Crabbe,\" he said. \"Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked.\" \n",
      "When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \"What is a wizard's duel?\" said Harry. \"And what do you mean, you're my second?\" \n",
      "\"Well, a second's there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\" \n",
      "\"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\" \n",
      "\"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested. \n",
      "\"Excuse me. \n",
      "They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. \n",
      "\"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?\" said Ron. \n",
      "Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. \n",
      "\"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —\" \n",
      "\"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered. \n",
      "\"— and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. It's really very selfish of you.\" \n",
      "\"And it's really none of your business,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Good-bye,\" said Ron. \n",
      "All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to  block them.\" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy's sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn't miss it. \n",
      "\"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we'd better go.\" \n",
      "They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry.\" \n",
      "A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. \n",
      "\"You!\" said Ron furiously. \"Go back to bed!\" \n",
      "\"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy — he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this.\" \n",
      "Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering. \n",
      "\"Come on,\" he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. \n",
      "Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. \n",
      "\"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\" \n",
      "\"Go away.\" \"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so —\" \n",
      "But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. \n",
      "\"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly. \n",
      "\"That's your problem,\" said Ron. \"We've got to go, we're going to be late.\" \n",
      "They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. \n",
      "\"I'm coming with you,\" she said. \n",
      "\"You are not.\" \n",
      "\"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\" \n",
      "\"You've got some nerve —\" said Ron loudly. \n",
      "\"Shut up, both of you!\" said Harry sharply. \"I heard something.\" \n",
      "It was a sort of snuffling. \n",
      "\"Mrs. Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. \n",
      "It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. \n",
      "\"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed.\" \n",
      "\"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere.\" \n",
      "\"How's your arm?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\" \"Good — well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later —\" \n",
      "\"Don't leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already.\" \n",
      "Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. \n",
      "\"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you. \n",
      "Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. \n",
      "They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. \n",
      "Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. \n",
      "\"He's late, maybe he's chickened out,\" Ron whispered. \n",
      "Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn't Malfoy. \n",
      "\"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\" \n",
      "It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. \n",
      "\"They're in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\" \n",
      "\"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor. \n",
      "The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle. \n",
      "\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room. \n",
      "\"I think we've lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. \n",
      "\"I — told — you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \"I — told — you.\" \n",
      "\"We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as possible.\" \"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don't you? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\" \n",
      "Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that. \n",
      "\"Let's go.\" \n",
      "It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. \n",
      "It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. \n",
      "\"Shut up, Peeves — please — you'll get us thrown out.\" \n",
      "Peeves cackled. \n",
      "\"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty.\" \n",
      "\"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please.\" \n",
      "\"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a sanity voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \"It's for your own good, you know.\" \n",
      "\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves — this was a big mistake. \n",
      "\"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\" \n",
      "Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked. \n",
      "\"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We're done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts. \n",
      "\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \"Alohomora!\" \n",
      "The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. \n",
      "\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\" \n",
      "\"Say 'please.' \" \n",
      "\"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\" \n",
      "\"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. \n",
      "\"All right — please.\" \n",
      "\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. \n",
      "\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we'll be okay — get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\" \n",
      "Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. \n",
      "They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. \n",
      "They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching  and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. \n",
      "It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. \n",
      "Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he'd take Filch. \n",
      "They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. \n",
      "\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. \n",
      "\"Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. \n",
      "It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again. \n",
      "\"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\" \n",
      "Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn't you see what it was standing on?\" \n",
      "\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\" \n",
      "\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something.\" \n",
      "She stood up, glaring at them. \n",
      "\"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\" \n",
      "Ron stared after her, his mouth open. \n",
      "\"No, we don't mind,\" he said. \"You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you?\" \n",
      "But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hog-warts. \n",
      "It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\n",
      "\n",
      "HALLOWEEN\n",
      "alfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \n",
      "\"It's either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Or both,\" said Harry. \n",
      "But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. \n",
      "Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. \n",
      "Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. \n",
      "As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. \n",
      "Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: \n",
      "DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. \n",
      "It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't \n",
      "want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll \n",
      "all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the \n",
      "Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training ses\n",
      "sion. \n",
      "Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. \"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I've never even touched one.\" \n",
      "They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. \n",
      "\"That's a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them.\" \n",
      "Ron couldn't resist it. \n",
      "\"It's not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus.\" \n",
      "\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\" \n",
      "Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow. \n",
      "\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked. \n",
      "\"Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly. \n",
      "\"Yes, yes, that's right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\" \n",
      "\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy's face. \"And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've got it,\" he added. \n",
      "Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it's true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouldn't be on the team. . . .\" \n",
      "\"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?\" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand. \n",
      "\"I thought you weren't speaking to us?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Yes, don't stop now,\" said Ron, \"it's doing us so much good.\" \n",
      "Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. \n",
      "Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. \n",
      "\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread. \n",
      "Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. \n",
      "As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He'd never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle  children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. \n",
      "Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. \n",
      "\"Hey, Potter, come down!\" \n",
      "Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him. \n",
      "\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall meant . . . you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.\" \n",
      "He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. \n",
      "\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\" \n",
      "\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \n",
      "\"This ball's called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\" \n",
      "\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" Harry recited. \"So — that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?\" \n",
      "\"What's basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly. \n",
      "\"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper — I'm Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\" \n",
      "\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. \n",
      "\"I'll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\" \n",
      "He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. \n",
      "\"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are the Bludgers.\" \n",
      "He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. \n",
      "\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. \n",
      "At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. \n",
      "\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you've got all that?\" \"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off. \n",
      "\"Very good,\" said Wood. \n",
      "\"Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. \n",
      "\"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —\" \n",
      "\"— unless they crack my head open.\" \n",
      "\"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\" \n",
      "Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. \n",
      "\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that's it — any questions?\" \n",
      "Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. \n",
      "\"We won't practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out with a few of these.\" \n",
      "He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. \n",
      "Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on. \n",
      "\"That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons.\" \n",
      "Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. \n",
      "On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's  partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived. \n",
      "\"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\" \n",
      "It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat. \n",
      "Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck. \n",
      "\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. \n",
      "\"You're saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.\" \n",
      "\"You do it, then, if you're so clever,\" Ron snarled. \n",
      "Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" \n",
      "Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. \n",
      "\"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!\" \n",
      "Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It's no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she's a nightmare, honestly.\" \n",
      "Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in tears. \n",
      "\"I think she heard you.\" \n",
      "\"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must've noticed she's got no friends.\" \n",
      "Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. \n",
      "A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. \n",
      "Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.\" \n",
      "He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. \n",
      "There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence. \"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\" \n",
      "Percy was in his element. \n",
      "\"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!\" \n",
      "\"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. \n",
      "\"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\" \n",
      "They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm. \n",
      "\"I've just thought — Hermione.\" \n",
      "\"What about her?\" \n",
      "\"She doesn't know about the troll.\" \n",
      "Ron bit his lip. \n",
      "\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy'd better not see us.\" \n",
      "Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. \n",
      "\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. \n",
      "Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. \n",
      "\"What's he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\" \n",
      "\"Search me.\" Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps. \n",
      "\"He's heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. \n",
      "\"Can you smell something?\" \n",
      "Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. \n",
      "And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. \n",
      "It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. \n",
      "The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. \n",
      "\"The key's in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\" \n",
      "\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously. \n",
      "They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. \n",
      "\"Yes!\" \n",
      "Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up. \n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. \n",
      "\"It's the girls' bathroom!\" Harry gasped. \n",
      "\"Hermione!\" they said together. \n",
      "It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. \n",
      "Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. \n",
      "\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. \n",
      "The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. \n",
      "\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. \n",
      "\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. \n",
      "The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll  berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. \n",
      "Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils. \n",
      "Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. \n",
      "Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" \n",
      "The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. \n",
      "Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. \n",
      "It was Hermione who spoke first. \n",
      "\"Is it — dead?\" \n",
      "\"I don't think so,\" said Harry, \"I think it's just been knocked out.\" \n",
      "He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. \"Urgh — troll boogers.\" \n",
      "He wiped it on the troll's trousers. \n",
      "A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. \n",
      "Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind. \n",
      "\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \"You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory?\" \n",
      "Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. \n",
      "Then a small voice came out of the shadows. \n",
      "\"Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.\" \n",
      "\"Miss Granger!\" \n",
      "Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. \n",
      "\"I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know, because I've read all about them.\" \n",
      "Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? \"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\" \n",
      "Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them. \n",
      "\"Well — in that case . . .\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\" \n",
      "Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. \n",
      "\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are finishing the feast in their Houses.\" \n",
      "Hermione left. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. \n",
      "\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\" \n",
      "They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. \n",
      "\"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled. \n",
      "\"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.\" \"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind you, we did save her.\" \n",
      "\"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her,\" Harry reminded him. \n",
      "They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \n",
      "\"Pig snout,\" they said and entered. \n",
      "The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates. \n",
      "But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "QUIDDITCH\n",
      "As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House Championship. Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse — people telling him he'd be  brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress. \n",
      "It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. \n",
      "Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. \n",
      "Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. \n",
      "\"What's that you've got there, Potter?\" \n",
      "It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. \"Library books are not to be taken outside the school,\" said Snape. \"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\" \n",
      "\"He's just made that rule up,\" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. \"Wonder what's wrong with his leg?\" \n",
      "\"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,\" said Ron bitterly. \n",
      "The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How will you learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. \n",
      "Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. \n",
      "\"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening. \n",
      "He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. \n",
      "Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside — and a horrible scene met his eyes. \n",
      "Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages. \n",
      "\"Blasted thing,\" Snape was saying. \"How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\" \n",
      "Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — \"POTTER!\" \n",
      "Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. \n",
      "\"I just wondered if I could have my book back.\" \n",
      "\"GET OUT! OUT !\" \n",
      "Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. \n",
      "\"Did you get it?\" Ron asked as Harry joined them. \"What's the matter?\" \n",
      "In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen. \n",
      "\"You know what this means?\" he finished breathlessly. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when we saw him — he's after whatever it's guarding! And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\" \n",
      "Hermione's eyes were wide. \n",
      "\"No — he wouldn't,\" she said. \"I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\" \n",
      "\"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\" snapped Ron. \"I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But what's he after? What's that dog guarding?\" \n",
      "Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget. \n",
      "The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer- ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch \n",
      "match. \n",
      "\"You've got to eat some breakfast.\" \n",
      "\"I don't want anything.\" \n",
      "\"Just a bit of toast,\" wheedled Hermione. \n",
      "\"I'm not hungry.\" \n",
      "Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field. \n",
      "\"Harry, you need your strength,\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\" \n",
      "\"Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. \n",
      "By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. \n",
      "Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors. \n",
      "Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green). \n",
      "Wood cleared his throat for silence. \"Okay, men,\" he said. \n",
      "\"And women,\" said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \n",
      "\"And women,\" Wood agreed. \"This is it.\" \n",
      "\"The big one,\" said Fred Weasley. \n",
      "\"The one we've all been waiting for,\" said George. \n",
      "\"We know Oliver's speech by heart,\" Fred told Harry, \"we were on the team last year.\" \n",
      "\"Shut up, you two,\" said Wood. \"This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years. We're going to win. I know it.\" \n",
      "He glared at them all as if to say, \"Or else.\" \n",
      "\"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you.\" \n",
      "Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. \n",
      "Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. \n",
      "\"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\" she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. \n",
      "\"Mount your brooms, please.\" \n",
      "Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. \n",
      "Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. \n",
      "Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. \n",
      "\"And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather at\n",
      "tractive, too —\" \n",
      "\"JORDAN!\" \n",
      "\"Sorry, Professor.\" \n",
      "The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. \n",
      "\"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she's really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\" \n",
      "Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. \n",
      "\"Budge up there, move along.\" \n",
      "\"Hagrid!\" \n",
      "Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them. \"Bin watchin' from me hut,\" said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \"But it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\" \n",
      "\"Nope,\" said Ron. \"Harry hasn't had much to do yet.\" \n",
      "\"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin',\" said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry. \n",
      "Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan. \n",
      "\"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had said. \"We don't want you attacked before you have to be.\" \n",
      "When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it. \n",
      "\"All right there, Harry?\" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. \n",
      "\"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch?\" \n",
      "A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear. \n",
      "Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch. \n",
      "Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of speed — \n",
      "WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. \n",
      "\"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors. \n",
      "Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. \n",
      "Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref! Red card!\" \n",
      "\"What are you talking about, Dean?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Red card!\" said Dean furiously. \"In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!\" \n",
      "\"But this isn't soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him. \n",
      "Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side. \n",
      "\"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\" \n",
      "Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \n",
      "\"So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —\" \n",
      "\"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall. \n",
      "\"I mean, after that open and revolting foul —\" \n",
      "\"Jordan, I'm warning you —\" \n",
      "\"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor,  taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\" \n",
      "It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt anything like that. \n",
      "It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. \n",
      "Lee was still commentating. \n",
      "\"Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no . . .\" \n",
      "The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went. \n",
      "\"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing,\" Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \"If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of his broom . . . but he can't have. . . .\" \n",
      "Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands.  His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand. \n",
      "\"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\" Seamus whispered. \n",
      "\"Can't have,\" Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \"Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\" \n",
      "At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd. \n",
      "\"What are you doing?\" moaned Ron, gray-faced. \n",
      "\"I knew it,\" Hermione gasped, \"Snape — look.\" \n",
      "Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. \n",
      "\"He's doing something — jinxing the broom,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"What should we do?\" \n",
      "\"Leave it to me.\" \n",
      "Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good — every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus  Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone \n",
      "noticing. \n",
      "\"Come on, Hermione,\" Ron muttered desperately. \n",
      "Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes. \n",
      "It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know what had happened. \n",
      "It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. \n",
      "\"Neville, you can look!\" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes. \n",
      "Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand. \n",
      "\"I've got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion. \n",
      "\"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being  made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione. \n",
      "\"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.\" \n",
      "\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do some-thin' like that?\" \n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. \n",
      "\"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding.\" \n",
      "Hagrid dropped the teapot. \n",
      "\"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said. \n",
      "\"Fluffy?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah — he's mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the —\" \n",
      "\"Yes?\" said Harry eagerly. \n",
      "\"Now, don't ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That's top secret, that is.\" \n",
      "\"But Snape's trying to steal it.\" \n",
      "\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid again. \"Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort.\" \n",
      "\"So why did he just try and kill Harry?\" cried Hermione. \n",
      "The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. \n",
      "\"I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!  You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!\" \n",
      "\"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!\" said Hagrid hotly. \"I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel —\" \n",
      "\"Aha!\" said Harry, \"so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\" \n",
      "Hagrid looked furious with himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE MIRROR OF ERISED\n",
      "Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. \"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home.\" \n",
      "He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. \n",
      "It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. \n",
      "When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it. \n",
      "\"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches. \n",
      "\"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron.\" \n",
      "\"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoy's cold drawl from behind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to.\" \n",
      "Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \n",
      "\"WEASLEY!\" \n",
      "Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes. \n",
      "\"He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \"Malfoy was insultin' his family.\" \n",
      "\"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said Snape silkily. \"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you.\" \n",
      "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \n",
      "\"I'll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, \"one of these days, I'll get him —\" \n",
      "\"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\" \n",
      "\"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,\" said Hagrid. \"Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\" \n",
      "So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. \n",
      "\"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?\" \n",
      "The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. \n",
      "\"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked. \"Just one,\" said Hermione. \"And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\" \n",
      "\"Oh yeah, you're right,\" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. \n",
      "\"The library?\" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \"Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, we're not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is.\" \n",
      "\"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here — I've told yeh — drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'.\" \n",
      "\"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I've read his name somewhere.\" \n",
      "\"I'm sayin' nothin',\" said Hagrid flatly. \n",
      "\"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. \n",
      "They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. \n",
      "Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \n",
      "\"What are you looking for, boy?\" \n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. \n",
      "\"You'd better get out, then. Go on — out!\" \n",
      "Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to. \n",
      "Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. \n",
      "\"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?\" said Hermione. \"And send me an owl if you find anything.\" \n",
      "\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron. \"It'd be safe to ask them.\" \n",
      "\"Very safe, as they're both dentists,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work. \n",
      "Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. \n",
      "Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. \n",
      "\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. \n",
      "\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I've got some presents!\" \n",
      "\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's. \n",
      "Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl. \n",
      "A second, very small parcel contained a note. \n",
      "We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece. \n",
      "\"That's friendly,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \n",
      "\"Weird!\" he said, \"What a shape! This is money?\" \n",
      "\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?\" \n",
      "\"I think I know who that one's from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn't expect any presents and — oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she's made you a Weasley sweater.\" \n",
      "Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. \"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and mine's always maroon.\" \n",
      "\"That's really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty. \n",
      "His next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. \n",
      "This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. \n",
      "Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. \n",
      "\"I've heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. \"If that's what I think it is — they're really rare, and really valuable.\" \n",
      "\"What is it?\" \n",
      "Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. \n",
      "\"It's an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I'm sure it is — try it on.\" \n",
      "Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell. \n",
      "\"It is! Look down!\" \n",
      "Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. \n",
      "\"There's a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\" \n",
      "Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before \n",
      "he died. It is time it was returned to you. \n",
      "Use it well. \n",
      "A Very Merry Christmas to you. \n",
      "There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak. \n",
      "\"I'd give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What's the matter?\" \n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? \n",
      "Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. \n",
      "\"Merry Christmas!\" \n",
      "\"Hey, look — Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\" \n",
      "Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. \n",
      "\"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.\" \n",
      "\"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.\" \n",
      "\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. \n",
      "\"You haven't got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid — we know we're called Gred and Forge.\" \"What's all this noise?\" \n",
      "Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. \n",
      "\"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\" \n",
      "\"I — don't — want —\" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. \n",
      "\"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George. \"Christmas is a time for family.\" \n",
      "They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater. \n",
      "Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. \n",
      "Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. \n",
      "When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner. \n",
      "Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much. \n",
      "After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge. \n",
      "It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it. \n",
      "Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. His father's . . . this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said. \n",
      "He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. \n",
      "Use it well. \n",
      "Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. \n",
      "Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back — his father's cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use it alone. \n",
      "He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. \n",
      "\"Who's there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. \n",
      "Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked. \n",
      "The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. \n",
      "The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. \n",
      "They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be. \n",
      "He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. \n",
      "A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears. \n",
      "He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library — Restricted Section.\" \n",
      "Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.\" \n",
      "Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him — the cloak didn't stop him from being solid. \n",
      "He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. \n",
      "It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. \n",
      "It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. \n",
      "He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. \n",
      "But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. \n",
      "There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? \n",
      "He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air — she and the others existed only in the mirror. \n",
      "She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did. \n",
      "Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. \"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\" \n",
      "They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. \n",
      "The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. \n",
      "How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, \"I'll come back,\" and hurried from the room. \n",
      "\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly. \n",
      "\"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.\" \n",
      "\"I'd like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly. \n",
      "\"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\" \n",
      "\"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?\" \n",
      "Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the threeheaded dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \n",
      "\"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\" \n",
      "What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. \n",
      "\"I'm freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let's forget it and go back.\" \n",
      "\"No!\" Harry hissed. \"I know it's here somewhere.\" \n",
      "They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. \n",
      "\"It's here — just here — yes!\" \n",
      "They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. \n",
      "There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. \n",
      "\"See?\" Harry whispered. \n",
      "\"I can't see anything.\" \n",
      "\"Look! Look at them all . . . there are loads of them. . . .\" \n",
      "\"I can only see you.\" \n",
      "\"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\" \n",
      "Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. \n",
      "Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \n",
      "\"Look at me!\" he said. \n",
      "\"Can you see all your family standing around you?\" \"No — I'm alone — but I'm different — I look older — and I'm Head Boy!\" \n",
      "\"What?\" \n",
      "\"I am — I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I'm holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I'm Quidditch captain, too!\" \n",
      "Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. \n",
      "\"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\" \n",
      "\"How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —\" \n",
      "\"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\" \n",
      "\"You're only holding the Quidditch Cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\" \n",
      "\"Don't push me —\" \n",
      "A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking. \n",
      "\"Quick!\" \n",
      "Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left. \n",
      "\"This isn't safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\" \n",
      "And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. \n",
      "The snow still hadn't melted the next morning. \n",
      "\"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"No.\" \"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?\" \n",
      "\"No . . . you go . . .\" \n",
      "\"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight.\" \n",
      "\"Why not?\" \n",
      "\"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\" \n",
      "\"You sound like Hermione.\" \n",
      "\"I'm serious, Harry, don't go.\" \n",
      "But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him. \n",
      "That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone. \n",
      "And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. \n",
      "Except — \n",
      "\"So — back again, Harry?\" \n",
      "Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him. \n",
      "\"I — I didn't see you, sir.\" \"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. \n",
      "\"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\" \n",
      "\"I didn't know it was called that, sir.\" \n",
      "\"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?\" \n",
      "\"It — well — it shows me my family —\" \n",
      "\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.\" \n",
      "\"How did you know — ?\" \n",
      "\"I don't need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\" \n",
      "Harry shook his head. \n",
      "\"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\" \n",
      "Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want . . . whatever we want . . .\" \n",
      "\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. \n",
      "\"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry,  and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\" \n",
      "Harry stood up. \n",
      "\"Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\" \n",
      "\"Obviously, you've just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one more thing, however.\" \n",
      "\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \n",
      "\"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" \n",
      "Harry stared. \n",
      "\"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\" \n",
      "It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\n",
      "\n",
      "NICHOLAS FLAMEL\n",
      "Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. \"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again. \n",
      "Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training. \n",
      "Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. \n",
      "\"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\" \n",
      "George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. \n",
      "\"Snape's refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\" \n",
      "The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. \n",
      "\"It's not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us.\" Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quid-ditch. . . . \n",
      "The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. \n",
      "\"Don't talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \"I need to concen-\" He caught sight of Harry's face. \"What's the matter with you? You look terrible.\" \n",
      "Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. \n",
      "\"Don't play,\" said Hermione at once. \n",
      "\"Say you're ill,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested. \n",
      "\"Really break your leg,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"I can't,\" said Harry. \"There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can't play at all.\" \n",
      "At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. \n",
      "Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron. \n",
      "\"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on.\" \n",
      "\"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report him!\" \n",
      "Neville shook his head. \n",
      "\"I don't want more trouble,\" he mumbled. \n",
      "\"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\" \n",
      "\"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that,\" Neville choked out. \n",
      "Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry. \n",
      "\"You're worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\" \n",
      "Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. \n",
      "\"Thanks, Harry . . . I think I'll go to bed. . . . D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?\" \n",
      "As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card. \n",
      "\"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever —\" \n",
      "He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione. \"I've found him!\" he whispered. \"I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!\" \n",
      "Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework. \n",
      "\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. \n",
      "\"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\" \n",
      "\"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. \n",
      "At last she found what she was looking for. \n",
      "\"I knew it! I knew it!\" \n",
      "\"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him. \n",
      "\"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!\" \n",
      "This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected. \n",
      "\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron. \n",
      "\"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look — read that, there.\" \n",
      "She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. \n",
      "There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). \n",
      "\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\" \n",
      "\"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry. \"No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it.\" \n",
      "\"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?\" \n",
      "The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. \"I'm going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show them . . . it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\" \n",
      "\"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? \n",
      "Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds. \n",
      "Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand. \n",
      "Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. \n",
      "\"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. \n",
      "\"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don't nag.\" \n",
      "Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside. \n",
      "\"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\" \n",
      "\"The whole school's out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \"Even — blimey — Dumbledore's come to watch!\" \n",
      "Harry's heart did a somersault. \n",
      "\"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. \n",
      "Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. \n",
      "Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too. \n",
      "\"I've never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione. \"Look — they're off. Ouch!\" \n",
      "Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy. \n",
      "\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there.\" \n",
      "Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. \n",
      "\"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\" Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch. \n",
      "\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money — you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains.\" \n",
      "Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy. \n",
      "\"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered. \n",
      "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville.\" \n",
      "\"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something.\" \n",
      "Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry. \n",
      "\"I'm warning you, Malfoy — one more word —\" \n",
      "\"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry — !\" \n",
      "\"What? Where?\" \n",
      "Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \n",
      "\"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said Malfoy. Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. \n",
      "\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. \n",
      "Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand. \n",
      "The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly. \n",
      "\"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. \n",
      "Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it — the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face. \n",
      "\"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . excellent . . .\" \n",
      "Snape spat bitterly on the ground.&bull; Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now — no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. \n",
      "Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape. . . . \n",
      "And speaking of Snape . . . \n",
      "A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner — what was going on? \n",
      "Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. \n",
      "The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree. \n",
      "He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying. \n",
      "\". . . d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus . . .\" \n",
      "\"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy. \"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all.\" \n",
      "Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him. \n",
      "\"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?\" \n",
      "\"B-b-but Severus, I —\" \n",
      "\"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step toward him. \n",
      "\"I-I don't know what you —\" \n",
      "\"You know perfectly well what I mean.\" \n",
      "An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \"— your little bit of hocus-pocus. I'm waiting.\" \n",
      "\"B-but I d-d-don't —\" \n",
      "\"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\" \n",
      "He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified. \"Harry, where have you been?\" Hermione squeaked. \n",
      "\"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he'll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\" \n",
      "\"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this. . . .\" \n",
      "He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard. \n",
      "\"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocuspocus' — I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through —\" \n",
      "\"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\" said Hermione in alarm. \n",
      "\"It'll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\n",
      "Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet. \n",
      "Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter. \n",
      "Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. \n",
      "\"Hermione, the exams are ages away.\" \n",
      "\"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\" \n",
      "\"But we're not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \"Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it all.\" \n",
      "\"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me. \n",
      "Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. \n",
      "\"I'll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming. \n",
      "Harry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?\" \n",
      "Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. \n",
      "\"Jus' lookin',\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \"An' what're you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \"Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \"And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St —\" \n",
      "\"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?\" \n",
      "\"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said Harry, \"about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —\" \n",
      "\"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \"Listen — come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh —\" \n",
      "\"See you later, then,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Hagrid shuffled off. \n",
      "\"What was he hiding behind his back?\" said Hermione thoughtfully. \n",
      "\"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\" \n",
      "\"I'm going to see what section he was in,\" said Ron, who'd had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. \n",
      "\"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide.\" \n",
      "\"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"But it's against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden — anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dan- \n",
      "gerous. You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Ro\n",
      "mania.\" \n",
      "\"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Of course there are,\" said Ron. \"Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget.\" \n",
      "\"So what on earth's Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione. \n",
      "When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them. \n",
      "It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused. \n",
      "\"So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \"We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from Fluffy.\" \n",
      "Hagrid frowned at him. \n",
      "\"O' course I can't,\" he said. \"Number one, I don' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\" said  Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \"We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\" Hermione went on. \"We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\" \n",
      "Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione. \n",
      "\"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that . . . let's see . . . he borrowed Fluffy from me . . . then some o' the teachers did enchantments . . . Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —\" he ticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell — an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\" \n",
      "\"Snape?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah — yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it.\" \n",
      "Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy. \n",
      "\"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren't you, Hagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\" \n",
      "\"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly. \n",
      "\"Well, that's something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Ha-grid, can we have a window open? I'm boiling.\" \n",
      "\"Can't, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. \n",
      "\"Hagrid — what's that?\" \n",
      "But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That's — er . . .\" \n",
      "\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \"It must've cost you a fortune.\" \n",
      "\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\" \n",
      "\"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"Well, I've bin doin' some readin',\" said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on 'em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An' see here — how ter recognize diff'rent eggs — what I got there's a Norwegian Ridge-back. They're rare, them.\" \n",
      "He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't. \n",
      "\"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said. \n",
      "But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire. \n",
      "So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. \n",
      "Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It's hatching. \n",
      "Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn't hear of it. \n",
      "\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\" \n",
      "\"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing —\" \n",
      "\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered. \n",
      "Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all. \n",
      "Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited. \n",
      "\"It's nearly out.\" He ushered them inside. \n",
      "The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it. \n",
      "They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath. \n",
      "All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. \n",
      "It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \n",
      "\"Isn't he beautiful?\" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs. \n",
      "\"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid. \n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\" \n",
      "Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. \n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" \n",
      "\"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains — it's a kid — he's runnin' back up ter the school.\" \n",
      "Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him. \n",
      "Malfoy had seen the dragon. \n",
      "Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him. \n",
      "\"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\" \n",
      "\"I can't,\" said Hagrid. \"He's too little. He'd die.\" They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor. \n",
      "\"I've decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mommy?\" \n",
      "\"He's lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry's ear. \n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\" \n",
      "Hagrid bit his lip. \n",
      "\"I — I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, can't.\" \n",
      "Harry suddenly turned to Ron. \n",
      "\"Charlie,\" he said. \n",
      "\"You're losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I'm Ron, remember?\" \n",
      "\"No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\" \n",
      "\"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\" \n",
      "And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him. \n",
      "The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just  \n",
      "chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. \n",
      "\"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \"I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\" \n",
      "There was a tap on the dark window. \"It's Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She'll have Charlie's answer!\" The three of them put their heads together to read the note. \n",
      "Dear Ron, \n",
      "How are you? Thanks for the letter — I'd be glad to take \n",
      "the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him \n",
      "here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with \n",
      "some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. \n",
      "Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon. \n",
      "Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark. \n",
      "Send me an answer as soon as possible. \n",
      "Love, \n",
      "Charlie They looked at one another. \n",
      "\"We've got the Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn't be too difficult — I think the cloak's big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\" \n",
      "It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy. \n",
      "There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey — would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous. \n",
      "Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed. \n",
      "\"It's not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it's about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me — I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this.\" \n",
      "Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. \n",
      "\"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. \n",
      "\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no — oh no — I've just remembered — Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.\" \n",
      "Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. \n",
      "\"It's too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.\" \n",
      "They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them. \n",
      "\"I won't let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert's at a tricky stage — nothin' I can't handle.\" \n",
      "When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. \n",
      "\"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot — jus' playin' — he's only a baby, after all.\" \n",
      "The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough. \n",
      "They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \n",
      "\"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Ha-grid in a muffled voice. \"An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\" \n",
      "From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off. \n",
      "\"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \"Mommy will never forget you!\" \n",
      "How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another — even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier. \n",
      "\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower. \n",
      "Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. \n",
      "Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear. \n",
      "\"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you —\" \n",
      "\"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming — he's got a dragon!\" \n",
      "\"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\" \n",
      "The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \n",
      "\"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!\" \n",
      "\"Don't,\" Harry advised her. \n",
      "Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. \n",
      "Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much. \n",
      "At last, Norbert was going . . . going . . . gone. \n",
      "They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — what could spoil their happiness? \n",
      "The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness. \n",
      "\"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\" \n",
      "They'd left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE FORBIDDEN FOREST\n",
      "Things couldn't have been worse. Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already. Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville. \"Harry!\" Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag —\" \n",
      "Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them. \n",
      "\"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\" \n",
      "It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. \n",
      "\"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\" \n",
      "Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them. \n",
      "\"I'm disgusted,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Four students out of bed in one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\" \"Fifty?\" Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last Quidditch match. \n",
      "\"Fifty points each,\" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. \n",
      "\"Professor — please —\" \n",
      "\"You can't —\" \n",
      "\"Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\" \n",
      "A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? \n",
      "Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done? \n",
      "At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the House points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years. \n",
      "From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \"Thanks Potter, we owe you one!\" \n",
      "Only Ron stood by him. \n",
      "\"They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them.\" \n",
      "\"They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\" said Harry miserably. \n",
      "\"Well — no,\" Ron admitted. \n",
      "It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team. \n",
      "\"Resign?\" Wood thundered. \"What good'll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?\" \n",
      "But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \"the Seeker.\" \n",
      "Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence. \n",
      "Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. . . . \n",
      "Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice. \n",
      "\"No — no — not again, please —\" \n",
      "It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer. \n",
      "\"All right — all right —\" he heard Quirrell sob. \n",
      "Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling. \n",
      "All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last. \n",
      "Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard. \n",
      "\"Snape's done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —\" \n",
      "\"There's still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\" said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\" \n",
      "The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. \n",
      "\"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure.\" \n",
      "\"But we've got no proof !\" said Harry. \"Quirrell's too scared to back us up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot of explaining.\" \n",
      "Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't. \n",
      "\"If we just do a bit of poking around —\" \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we've done enough poking around.\" \n",
      "He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons. \n",
      "The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: \n",
      "Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got. \n",
      "At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too. \n",
      "\"Follow me,\" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside. \n",
      "\"I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh?\" he said, leering at them. \"Oh yes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me. . . . It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed. . . . Right, off we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do.\" \n",
      "They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted. \n",
      "The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut. Then they heard a distant shout. \n",
      "\"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\" \n",
      "Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn't be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, \"I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself  with that oaf? Well, think again, boy — it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece.\" \n",
      "At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. \n",
      "\"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual. \"We can't go in there at night — there's all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard.\" \n",
      "Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise. \n",
      "\"That's your problem, isn't it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \"Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?\" \n",
      "Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. \n",
      "\"Abou' time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\" \n",
      "\"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\" said Filch coldly, \"they're here to be punished, after all.\" \n",
      "\"That's why yer late, is it?\" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \"Bin lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit, I'll take over from here.\" \n",
      "\"I'll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what's left of them,\" he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness. \n",
      "Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. \n",
      "\"I'm not going in that forest,\" he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. \"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\" said Hagrid fiercely. \"Yeh've done wrong an' now yeh've got ter pay fer it.\" \n",
      "\"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd —\" \n",
      "\"— tell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts,\" Hagrid growled. \"Copyin' lines! What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or yeh'll get out. If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack. Go on!\" \n",
      "Malfoy didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze. \n",
      "\"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow me over here a moment.\" \n",
      "He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest. \n",
      "\"Look there,\" said Hagrid, \"see that stuff shinin' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\" \n",
      "\"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\" said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. \n",
      "\"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\" said Hagrid. \"An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff 'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' \n",
      "around since last night at least.\" \n",
      "\"I want Fang,\" said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth. \n",
      "\"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,\" said Hagrid. \"So me, Harry, an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practice now — that's it — an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh — so, be careful — let's go.\" \n",
      "The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. \n",
      "They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves. \n",
      "Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. \n",
      "\"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked. \n",
      "\"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\" \n",
      "They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path. \n",
      "\"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\" \n",
      "Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it  into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away. \n",
      "\"I knew it,\" he murmured. \"There's summat in here that shouldn' be.\" \n",
      "\"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested. \n",
      "\"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,\" said Hagrid grimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\" \n",
      "They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. \n",
      "\"Who's there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself — I'm armed!\" \n",
      "And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped. \n",
      "\"Oh, it's you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\" \n",
      "He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand. \n",
      "\"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\" \n",
      "\"Can't be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \"There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an' Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is Ronan, you two. He's a centaur.\" \n",
      "\"We'd noticed,\" said Hermione faintly. \n",
      "\"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\" \"Erm —\" \n",
      "\"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly. \n",
      "\"A bit. Well, that's something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\" \n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin'?\" \n",
      "Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. \n",
      "\"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said. \"So it has been for ages past, so it is now.\" \n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan? Any-thin' unusual?\" \n",
      "\"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \"Unusually bright.\" \n",
      "\"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home,\" said Hagrid. \"So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?\" \n",
      "Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \"The forest hides many secrets.\" \n",
      "A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan. \n",
      "\"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\" \n",
      "\"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\" \n",
      "\"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen any-thin' odd in here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin' about it?\" \n",
      "Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \"Mars is bright tonight,\" he said simply. \n",
      "\"We've heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. \"Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then.\" \n",
      "Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view. \n",
      "\"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the moon.\" \n",
      "\"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione. \n",
      "\"Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind, centaurs . . . they know things . . . jus' don' let on much.\" \n",
      "\"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicorns — never heard anythin' like it before.\" \n",
      "They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm. \n",
      "\"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\" \n",
      "\"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay on the path, I'll come back for yeh!\" \n",
      "They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them. \"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione. \n",
      "\"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville . . . it's our fault he's here in the first place.\" \n",
      "The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? \n",
      "At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. \n",
      "\"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'. Right, we're changin' groups — Neville, you stay with me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry,\" Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \"but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this done.\" \n",
      "So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak. \n",
      "\"Look —\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. \n",
      "Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. \n",
      "It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. \n",
      "Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. . . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animals side, and began to drink its blood. \n",
      "\"AAAAAAAAAAARGH!\" \n",
      "Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn't move for fear. \n",
      "Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. \n",
      "The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. \n",
      "\"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. \n",
      "\"Yes — thank you — what was that?\" \n",
      "The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead. \"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. \n",
      "\"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. \n",
      "There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. \n",
      "\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\" \n",
      "\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\" \n",
      "\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\" \n",
      "Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\" he said in his gloomy voice. \n",
      "Bane kicked his back legs in anger. \n",
      "\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\" \n",
      "Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. \n",
      "\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\" \n",
      "And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane be\n",
      "hind them. \n",
      "Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. \n",
      "\"Why's Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\" \n",
      "Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\" \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\" \n",
      "\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\" \n",
      "Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight. \n",
      "\"But who'd be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you're going to be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?\" \n",
      "\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength and power — something that will mean you  can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\" \n",
      "\"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don't understand who —\" \n",
      "\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\" \n",
      "It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\" \n",
      "\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol —\" \n",
      "\"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\" \n",
      "Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her. \n",
      "\"I'm fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The unicorns dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.\" \n",
      "\"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\" \n",
      "Harry slid off his back. \n",
      "\"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\" \n",
      "He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. \n",
      "Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest. \n",
      "Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking. \n",
      "\"Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort . . . and Voldemort's waiting in the forest . . . and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. \n",
      "Harry wasn't listening. \n",
      "\"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so. . . . Bane was furious . . . he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen. . . . They must show that Voldemort's coming back. . . . Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. . . . I suppose that's written in the stars as well.\" \n",
      "\"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed. \n",
      "\"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry went on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off. . . . Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy.\" \n",
      "Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort. \n",
      "\"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic.\" \n",
      "The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went  to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over. \n",
      "When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it: \n",
      "Just in case.\n",
      "\n",
      "THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n",
      "In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. \n",
      "Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. \n",
      "Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented self-stirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest. \n",
      "\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\" \n",
      "Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.\" \n",
      "Harry was rubbing his forehead. \n",
      "\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting — it's happened before, but never as often as this.\" \n",
      "\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested. \n",
      "\"I'm not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it's a warning . . . it means danger's coming. . . .\" \n",
      "Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot. \n",
      "\"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quid-ditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\" \n",
      "Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.\" \n",
      "Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Ha-grid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy . . . never . . . but — \n",
      "Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. \"Where're you going?\" said Ron sleepily. \n",
      "\"I've just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white. \"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.\" \n",
      "\"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \n",
      "\"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?\" \n",
      "\"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer. \n",
      "Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. \n",
      "\"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\" \n",
      "\"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off. \n",
      "\"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\" \n",
      "\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\" \n",
      "He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. \n",
      "\"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head — that's one o' the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\" \n",
      "Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\" \n",
      "\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \"Yeah . . . he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here. . . . He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after . . . so I told him . . . an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon . . . an' then . . . I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks. . . . Let's see . . . yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home. . . . So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. . . .\" \n",
      "\"And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. \n",
      "\"Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep —\" \n",
      "Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. \n",
      "\"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey — where're yeh goin'?\" \n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. \n",
      "\"We've got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must've been easy, once he'd got Ha-grid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him. Where's Dumbledore's office?\" They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. \n",
      "\"We'll just have to —\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. \n",
      "\"What are you three doing inside?\" \n",
      "It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. \n",
      "\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. \n",
      "\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\" \n",
      "Harry swallowed — now what? \n",
      "\"It's sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared. \n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\" \n",
      "\"He's gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\" \n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time —\" \n",
      "\"But this is important.\" \n",
      "\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\" \n",
      "\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor — it's about the Sorcerer's Stone —\" \n",
      "Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up. \"How do you know — ?\" she spluttered. \n",
      "\"Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone's going to try and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\" \n",
      "She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. \"I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected.\" \n",
      "\"But Professor —\" \n",
      "\"Potter, I know what I'm talking about,\" she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. \"I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\" \n",
      "But they didn't. \n",
      "\"It's tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \"Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\" \n",
      "\"But what can we —\" \n",
      "Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. \n",
      "Snape was standing there. \n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly. \n",
      "They stared at him. \n",
      "\"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile. \n",
      "\"We were —\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. \n",
      "\"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around  like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?\" \n",
      "Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. \n",
      "\"Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\" \n",
      "He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. \n",
      "Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \n",
      "\"Right, here's what we've got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that.\" \n",
      "\"Why me?\" \n",
      "\"It's obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \" 'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . .'\" \n",
      "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. \n",
      "\"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron. \"Come on.\" \n",
      "But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. \n",
      "\"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own House!\" Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione's on Snape's tail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. \n",
      "\"I'm sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went.\" \n",
      "\"Well, that's it then, isn't it?\" Harry said. \n",
      "The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. \n",
      "\"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first.\" \n",
      "\"You're mad!\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"You can't!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You'll be expelled!\" \n",
      "\"SO WHAT?\" Harry shouted. \"Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\" \n",
      "He glared at them. \"You're right, Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \n",
      "\"I'll use the Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lucky I got it back.\" \n",
      "\"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"All — all three of us?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?\" \n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go and look through my books, there might be something useful. . . .\" \n",
      "\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\" \n",
      "\"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not throwing me out after that.\" \n",
      "After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. \n",
      "Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \n",
      "\"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Ha-grid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn't feel much like singing. \n",
      "He ran back down to the common room. \"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —\" \n",
      "\"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom. \n",
      "\"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. \n",
      "Neville stared at their guilty faces. \n",
      "\"You're going out again,\" he said. \n",
      "\"No, no, no,\" said Hermione. \"No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?\" \n",
      "Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. \n",
      "\"You can't go out,\" said Neville, \"you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\" \n",
      "\"You don't understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\" \n",
      "But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. \n",
      "\"I won't let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \"I'll — I'll fight you!\" \n",
      "\"Neville,\" Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don't be an idiot —\" \n",
      "\"Don't you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. \"I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\" \"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don't know what you're doing.\" \n",
      "He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. \n",
      "\"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I'm ready!\" \n",
      "Harry turned to Hermione. \n",
      "\"Do something,\" he said desperately. \n",
      "Hermione stepped forward. \n",
      "\"Neville,\" she said, \"I'm really, really sorry about this.\" \n",
      "She raised her wand. \n",
      "\"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville. \n",
      "Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. \n",
      "Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. \n",
      "\"What've you done to him?\" Harry whispered. \n",
      "\"It's the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry.\" \n",
      "\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"You'll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. \n",
      "But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. \n",
      "\"Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything. \n",
      "They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. \n",
      "\"Who's there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \"Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\" \n",
      "He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. \n",
      "\"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.\" \n",
      "Harry had a sudden idea. \n",
      "\"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\" \n",
      "Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. \n",
      "\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,\" he said greasily. \"My mistake, my mistake — I didn't see you — of course I didn't, you're invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\" \n",
      "\"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this place tonight.\" \n",
      "\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.\" \n",
      "And he scooted off. \"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron. \n",
      "A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar. \n",
      "\"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape's already got past Fluffy.\" \n",
      "Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. \n",
      "\"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the cloak, I won't need it now.\" \n",
      "\"Don't be stupid,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"We're coming,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "Harry pushed the door open. \n",
      "As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them. \n",
      "\"What's that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered. \n",
      "\"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\" \n",
      "\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes . . .\" \n",
      "He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. \n",
      "\"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \"I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog's back. \"Want to go first, Hermione?\" \n",
      "\"No, I don't!\" \n",
      "\"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. \n",
      "\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously. \n",
      "\"Nothing — just black — there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop.\" \n",
      "Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. \n",
      "\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\" \n",
      "Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. \n",
      "Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. \n",
      "He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\" \n",
      "\"Right,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"See you in a minute, I hope. . . .\" \n",
      "And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and — \n",
      "FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on  something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. \n",
      "\"It's okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it's a soft landing, you can jump!\" \n",
      "Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. \n",
      "\"What's this stuff?\" were his first words. \n",
      "\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\" \n",
      "The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side. \n",
      "\"We must be miles under the school,\" she said. \n",
      "\"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\" \n",
      "She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. \n",
      "Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. \n",
      "\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is — it's Devil's Snare!\" \n",
      "\"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \n",
      "\"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp —\" \n",
      "\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked. \n",
      "\"Yes — of course — but there's no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. \n",
      "\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \n",
      "\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. \n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis — 'there's no wood,' honestly.\" \n",
      "\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. \n",
      "All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough . . . \"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered. \n",
      "Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. \n",
      "\"Do you think it's a ghost?\" \n",
      "\"I don't know . . . sounds like wings to me.\" \n",
      "\"There's light ahead — I can see something moving.\" \n",
      "They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. \n",
      "\"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . well, there's no other choice . . . I'll run.\" \n",
      "He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. \n",
      "The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm. \n",
      "\"Now what?\" said Ron. \n",
      "\"These birds . . . they can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering? \n",
      "\"They're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They're keys! Winged keys — look carefully. So that must mean . . .\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \". . . yes — look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\" \n",
      "\"But there are hundreds of them!\" \n",
      "Ron examined the lock on the door. \n",
      "\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the handle.\" \n",
      "They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. \n",
      "Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. \n",
      "\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\" \n",
      "Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. \n",
      "\"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down — and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\" \n",
      "Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against  the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber. \n",
      "They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned — it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. \n",
      "\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. \n",
      "The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. \n",
      "They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. \n",
      "\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered. \n",
      "\"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across the room.\" \n",
      "Behind the white pieces they could see another door. \n",
      "\"How?\" said Hermione nervously. \n",
      "\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\" \n",
      "He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. \n",
      "\"Do we — er — have to join you to get across?\" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. \n",
      "\"This needs thinking about. . . .\" he said. \"I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess —\" \n",
      "\"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\" \n",
      "\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.\" \n",
      "\"What about you?\" \n",
      "\"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Ron. \n",
      "The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. \n",
      "\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board. \"Yes . . . look . . .\" \n",
      "A white pawn had moved forward two squares. \n",
      "Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost? \n",
      "\"Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.\" \n",
      "Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. \n",
      "\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\" Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. \n",
      "\"We're nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think — let me think . . .\" \n",
      "The white queen turned her blank face toward him. \n",
      "\"Yes . . .\" said Ron softly, \"it's the only way . . . I've got to be taken.\" \n",
      "\"NO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted. \n",
      "\"That's chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You've got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and she'll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\" \n",
      "\"But —\" \n",
      "\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\" \n",
      "\"Ron —\" \n",
      "\"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\" \n",
      "There was no alternative. \n",
      "\"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go — now, don't hang around once you've won.\" \n",
      "He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out. \n",
      "Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. \n",
      "\"What if he's — ?\" \n",
      "\"He'll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do you reckon's next?\" \n",
      "\"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's . . .\" \n",
      "They had reached another door. \n",
      "\"All right?\" Harry whispered. \n",
      "\"Go on.\" \n",
      "Harry pushed it open. \n",
      "A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. \n",
      "\"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can't breathe.\" \n",
      "He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next — but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. \n",
      "\"Snape's,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\" \n",
      "They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped. \n",
      "\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: \n",
      "Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, \n",
      "Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, \n",
      "One among us seven will let you move ahead, \n",
      "Another will transport the drinker back instead, \n",
      "Two among our number hold only nettle wine, \n",
      "Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. \n",
      "Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, \n",
      "To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: \n",
      "First, however slyly the poison tries to hide \n",
      "You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; \n",
      "Second, different are those who stand at either end, \n",
      "But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; \n",
      "Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, \n",
      "Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; \n",
      "Fourth, the second left and the second on the right \n",
      "Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. \n",
      "Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing. \n",
      "\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn't magic — it's logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.\" \n",
      "\"But so will we, won't we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\" \n",
      "\"But how do we know which to drink?\" \n",
      "\"Give me a minute.\" \n",
      "Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands. \n",
      "\"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire — toward the Stone.\" \n",
      "Harry looked at the tiny bottle. \n",
      "\"There's only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That's hardly one swallow.\" \n",
      "They looked at each other. \n",
      "\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\" \n",
      "Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. \n",
      "\"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really.\" \n",
      "\"But Harry — what if You-Know-Who's with him?\" \n",
      "\"Well — I was lucky once, wasn't I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar. \"I might get lucky again.\" \n",
      "Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him. \"Hermione!\" \n",
      "\"Harry — you're a great wizard, you know.\" \n",
      "\"I'm not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. \n",
      "\"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!\" \n",
      "\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren't you?\" \n",
      "\"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \n",
      "\"It's not poison?\" said Harry anxiously. \n",
      "\"No — but it's like ice.\" \n",
      "\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\" \n",
      "\"Good luck — take care —\" \n",
      "\"GO!\" \n",
      "Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire. \n",
      "Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. \n",
      "\"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. \n",
      "It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other side, in the last chamber. \n",
      "There was already someone there — but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n",
      "It was Quirrell.  \"You!\" gasped Harry. Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all. \"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Potter.\" \"But I thought — Snape —\" \"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\" Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't. \"But Snape tried to kill me!\" \"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another \n",
      "few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\" \n",
      "\"Snape was trying to save me?\" \n",
      "\"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny, really . . . he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight.\" \n",
      "Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. \n",
      "\"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\" \n",
      "\"You let the troll in?\" \n",
      "\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly. \n",
      "\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\" \n",
      "It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. \n",
      "\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this . . . but he's in London . . . I'll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .\" \n",
      "All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror. \n",
      "\"I saw you and Snape in the forest —\" he blurted out. \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side. . . .\" \n",
      "Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. \n",
      "\"I see the Stone . . . I'm presenting it to my master . . . but where is it?\" \n",
      "Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror. \n",
      "\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\" \n",
      "\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was threatening you. \n",
      "For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face. \n",
      "\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master's instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak —\" \n",
      "\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped. \n",
      "\"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. . . . Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me . . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me. . . .\" \n",
      "Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. \n",
      "Quirrell cursed under his breath. \n",
      "\"I don't understand . . . is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\" \n",
      "Harry's mind was racing. \n",
      "What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it — which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to? \n",
      "He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\" \n",
      "And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself. \n",
      "\"Use the boy . . . Use the boy . . .\" \n",
      "Quirrell rounded on Harry. \n",
      "\"Yes — Potter — come here.\" \n",
      "He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. \n",
      "\"Come here,\" Quirrell repeated. \"Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.\" \n",
      "Harry walked toward him. \n",
      "I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that's all. \n",
      "Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. \n",
      "He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly — he'd gotten the Stone. \n",
      "\"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\" \n",
      "Harry screwed up his courage. \n",
      "\"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I — I've won the House Cup for Gryffindor.\" \n",
      "Quirrell cursed again. \n",
      "\"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? \n",
      "But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips. \n",
      "\"He lies . . . He lies . . .\" \n",
      "\"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What did you just see?\" \n",
      "The high voice spoke again. \n",
      "\"Let me speak to him . . . face-to-face. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Master, you are not strong enough!\" \n",
      "\"I have strength enough . . . for this. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot. \n",
      "Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter . . .\" it whispered. \n",
      "Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move. \n",
      "\"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor . . . I have form only when I can share another's body . . . but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds. . . . Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks . . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest . . . and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a  body of my own. . . . Now . . . why don't you give me that Stone in your pocket?\" \n",
      "So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He stumbled backward. \n",
      "\"Don't be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join me . . . or you'll meet the same end as your parents. . . . They died begging me for mercy. . . .\" \n",
      "\"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly. \n",
      "Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling. \n",
      "\"How touching . . .\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery. . . . Yes, boy, your parents were brave. . . . I killed your father first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but your mother needn't have died . . . she was trying to protect you. . . . Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\" \n",
      "\"NEVER!\" \n",
      "Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\" and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened — he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes. \n",
      "\"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harry's neck — Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. \n",
      "\"Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!\" \n",
      "And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. \n",
      "\"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort. \n",
      "Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face — \n",
      "\"AAAARGH!\" \n",
      "Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. \n",
      "Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry's head was building — he couldn't see — he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, \"KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, \"Harry! Harry!\" \n",
      "He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down . . . down . . . down . . . \n",
      "Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy. \n",
      "He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. \n",
      "He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him. \n",
      "\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir, quick —\" \n",
      "\"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said Dumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\" \n",
      "\"Then who does? Sir, I —\" \n",
      "\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\" \n",
      "Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. \n",
      "\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\" \n",
      "\"How long have I been in here?\" \n",
      "\"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\" \n",
      "\"But sir, the Stone —\" \n",
      "\"I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\" \n",
      "\"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?\" \n",
      "\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you —\" \n",
      "\"It was you.\" \n",
      "\"I feared I might be too late.\" \n",
      "\"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer —\" \n",
      "\"Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\" \n",
      "\"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend — Nicolas Flamel —\" \n",
      "\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.\" \n",
      "\"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?\" \n",
      "\"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face. \n",
      "\"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling. \n",
      "\"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I've been thinking . . . Sir — even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —\" \n",
      "\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\" \n",
      "\"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?\" \n",
      "\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share . . . not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\" \n",
      "Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \"Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can tell me . . . things I want to know the truth about. . . .\" \n",
      "\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\" \n",
      "\"Well . . . Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\" \n",
      "Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. \n",
      "\"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day . . . put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . . I know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, you will know.\" \n",
      "And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. \n",
      "\"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?\" \n",
      "\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign . . . to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\" \n",
      "Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \"And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent it to me?\" \n",
      "\"Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. \"Useful things . . . your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\" \n",
      "\"And there's something else . . .\" \n",
      "\"Fire away.\" \n",
      "\"Quirrell said Snape —\" \n",
      "\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\" \n",
      "\"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\" \n",
      "\"What?\" \n",
      "\"He saved his life.\" \n",
      "\"What?\" \n",
      "\"Yes . . .\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt. . . . I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. \n",
      "\"And sir, there's one more thing . . .\" \n",
      "\"Just the one?\" \n",
      "\"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\" \n",
      "\"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes. . . . Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking for them — but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't you?\" \n",
      "He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\" \n",
      "Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict. \n",
      "\"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded. \n",
      "\"Absolutely not.\" \n",
      "\"You let Professor Dumbledore in. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\" \n",
      "\"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey . . .\" \n",
      "\"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\" \n",
      "And she let Ron and Hermione in. \n",
      "\"Harry!\" \n",
      "Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. \n",
      "\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so worried —\" \n",
      "\"The whole school's talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\" \n",
      "It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud. \n",
      "\"So the Stone's gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel's just going to die?\" \n",
      "\"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? — 'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.' \" \n",
      "\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. \n",
      "\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor.\" \n",
      "\"D'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?\" \n",
      "\"Well,\" Hermione exploded, \"if he did — I mean to say — that's terrible — you could have been killed.\" \n",
      "\"No, it isn't,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly. \"Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food'll be good.\" \n",
      "At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. \n",
      "\"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,\" she said firmly. \n",
      "After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. \n",
      "\"I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. \"I can, can't I?\" \n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said sniffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\" \n",
      "Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears. \n",
      "\"It's — all — my — ruddy — fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands. \"I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!\" \n",
      "\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him.\" \n",
      "\"Yeh could've died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An' don' say the name!\" \n",
      "\"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \"I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I've got loads. . . .\" \n",
      "Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds me. I've got yeh a present.\" \n",
      "\"It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got yeh this . . .\" \n",
      "It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father. \n",
      "\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos . . . knew yeh didn' have any . . . d'yeh like it?\" \n",
      "Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood. \n",
      "Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table. \n",
      "When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. \n",
      "Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away. \n",
      "\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts. . . . \n",
      "\"Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\" \n",
      "A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. \n",
      "\"Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\" \n",
      "The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little. \n",
      "\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes . . . \n",
      "\"First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley . . .\" \n",
      "Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn. \n",
      "\". . . for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.\" \n",
      "Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!\" \n",
      "At last there was silence again. \n",
      "\"Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.\" \n",
      "Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves — they were a hundred points up. \"Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. \". . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.\" \n",
      "The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point. \n",
      "Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. \n",
      "\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\" \n",
      "Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him. \n",
      "\"Which means,\" Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\" \n",
      "He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was \n",
      "shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. \n",
      "It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls . . . he would never, ever forget tonight. \n",
      "Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life. \n",
      "And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they'll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross station. It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \n",
      "\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you — I'll send you an owl.\" \n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I'll need something to look forward to.\" \n",
      "People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: \n",
      "\"Bye, Harry!\" \n",
      "\"See you, Potter!\" \n",
      "\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him. \n",
      "\"Not where I'm going, I promise you,\" said Harry. \n",
      "He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \n",
      "\"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\" \n",
      "It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see —\" \n",
      "\"Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point.\" \n",
      "Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them. \n",
      "\"Busy year?\" she said. \n",
      "\"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\" \n",
      "\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\" \n",
      "\"Ready, are you?\" \n",
      "It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in \n",
      "a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia \n",
      "and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. \n",
      "\"You must be Harry's family!\" said Mrs. Weasley. \n",
      "\"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day.\" He walked away. \n",
      "Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione. \n",
      "\"See you over the summer, then.\" \n",
      "\"Hope you have — er — a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. \n",
      "\"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \"They don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer. . . .\"\n",

      "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\" Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing . . .\" Dudley's birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he  wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\" Don't ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put  together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\" Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty . . . thirty . . .\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction. Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. \"What about what's-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \". . . and leave him in the car. . . .\" \"That cars new, he's not sitting in it alone. . . .\" Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying — it had been years since he'd really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I . . . don't . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly . . .\" But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \". . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don't,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" The snake nodded vigorously. \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see — so you've never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He  couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n"

      "Harry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered again. Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out onto the landing, and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher's ancestors, and into the kitchen. He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and when he pushed it open he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment he entered. \"Breakfast,\" she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire. \"M-m-morning, Harry,\" yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning. \"Sleep all right?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"I've b-b-been up all night,\" she said, with another shuddering yawn. \"Come and sit down. . . .\" She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process. \"What do you want, Harry?\" Mrs. Weasley called. \"Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?\" \"Just — just toast, thanks,\" said Harry. Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, \"What were you saying about Scrimgeour?\" \"Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he's been asking Kingsley and me funny questions. . . .\" Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn't. \". . . and I'll have to tell Dumbledore I can't do night duty tomorrow, I'm just t-t-too tired,\" Tonks finished, yawning hugely again. \"I'll cover for you,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I'm okay, I've got a report to finish anyway. . . .\" Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard's robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry. \"How are you feeling?\" Harry shrugged. \"It'll all be over soon,\" Mr. Weasley said bracingly. \"In a few hours' time you'll be cleared.\" Harry said nothing. \"The hearing's on my floor, in Amelia Bones's office. She's Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she's the one who'll be questioning you.\" \"Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,\" said Tonks earnestly. \"She's fair, she'll hear you out.\" Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say. \"Don't lose your temper,\" said Sirius abruptly. \"Be polite and stick to the facts.\" Harry nodded again. \"The law's on your side,\" said Lupin quietly. \"Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.\" Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry's neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him again, then he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head. \"Doesn't it ever lie flat?\" she said desperately. Harry shook his head. Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry. \"I think we'll go now,\" he said. \"We're a bit early, but I think you'll be better off there than hanging around here.\" \"Okay,\" said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet. \"You'll be all right, Harry,\" said Tonks, patting him on the arm. \"Good luck,\" said Lupin. \"I'm sure it will be fine.\" \"And if it's not,\" said Sirius grimly, \"I'll see to Amelia Bones for you. . . .\" Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him. \"We've all got our fingers crossed,\" she said. \"Right,\" said Harry. \"Well . . . see you later then.\" He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear Sirius's mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn. \"You don't normally walk to work, do you?\" Harry asked him, as they set off briskly around the square. \"No, I usually Apparate,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"but obviously you can't, and I think it's best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . makes a better impression, given what you're being disciplined for. . . .\" Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Underground station they found it already full of early morning commuters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm. \"Simply fabulous,\" he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. \"Wonderfully ingenious.\" \"They're out of order,\" said Harry, pointing at the sign. \"Yes, but even so . . .\" said Mr. Weasley, beaming fondly at them. They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London. Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the Underground map above the windows. \"Four stops, Harry . . . three stops left now . . . two stops to go, Harry . . .\" They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up  the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged onto a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings, already full of traffic. \"Where are we?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley's continual references to the map; but a second later he said, \"Ah yes . . . this way, Harry,\" and led him down a side road. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I've never even used the visitor's entrance before.\" The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic. \"Here we are,\" said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffittied wall. \"After you, Harry.\" He opened the telephone box door. Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr. Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver. \"Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,\" Harry said. \"No, no, I'm sure it's fine,\" said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. \"Let's see . . . six . . .\" he dialed the number, \"two . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another two . . .\" As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr. Weasley's hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them. \"Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.\" \"Er . . .\" said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he should talk into the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, \"Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing. . . .\" \"Thank you,\" said the cool female voice. \"Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes.\" There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: It was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again. \"Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.\" The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes from watering. \"The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,\" said the woman's voice. The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open. They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and changing like some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart. Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat, and each of the house-elf's ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall. \"This way,\" said Mr. Weasley. They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, others battered briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as they walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A small, smudged sign beside it read: All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries If I'm not expelled from Hogwarts, I'll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately. \"Over here, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying security. A badly shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet. \"I'm escorting a visitor,\" said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry. \"Step over here,\" said the wizard in a bored voice. Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry's front and back. \"Wand,\" grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand. Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it. \"Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That correct?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry nervously. \"I keep this,\" said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike. \"You get this back,\" he added, thrusting the wand at Harry. \"Thank you.\" \"Hang on. . . .\" said the wizard slowly. His eyes had darted from the silver visitor's badge on Harry's chest to his forehead. \"Thank you, Eric,\" said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the shoulder, he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates. Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around one of them. A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises. \"All right, Arthur?\" said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley. \"What've you got there, Bob?\" asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the box. \"We're not sure,\" said the wizard seriously. \"We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.\" With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley moved inside it with the rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against the back wall of the lift. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone's eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling all the while, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again. \"Level seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.\" The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls; one of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upward again, and the woman's voice said, \"Level six, Department of Magical Transport, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Center.\" Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several paper airplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet color and he could see ministry of magic stamped along the edges of their wings. \"Just Interdepartmental memos,\" Mr. Weasley muttered to him. \"We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings all over the desks . . .\" As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped around the swaying lamp in the lift's ceiling. \"Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.\" When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they darted around it. \"Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.\" \" 'S'cuse,\" said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet again. \"Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.\" Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the ground. The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors opened and the voice said, \"Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.\" \"This is us, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. \"My office is on the other side of the floor.\" \"Mr. Weasley,\" said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, \"aren't we underground?\" \"Yes, we are,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"those are enchanted windows; Magical Maintenance decide what weather we're getting every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay raise. . . . Just round here, Harry.\" They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors, and emerged in a cluttered, open area divided into cubicles, which were buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquarters. Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill's was sitting with his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther along, a witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt. \"Morning, Weasley,\" said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. \"I've been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?\" \"Yes, if it really is a second,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"I'm in rather a hurry.\" They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle. Harry received a slight shock; Sirius's face was blinking down at him from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs — even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters' wedding — papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels. \"Here,\" said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand, \"I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We've received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.\" Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, \"Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.\" Then he said in normal tones, \"And don't take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.\" \"If you had read my report you would know that the term is 'firearms,' \" said Mr. Weasley coolly. \"And I'm afraid you'll have to wait for information on motorcycles, we're extremely busy at the moment.\" He dropped his voice and said, \"If you can get away before seven, Molly's making meatballs.\" He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley's cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artifacts. Mr. Weasley's dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley's obsessions; there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children's books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug. Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley's overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it. \"We haven't got a window,\" said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. \"We've asked, but they don't seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesn't look as if Perkins is in yet.\" Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins's desk while Mr. Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shackle-bolt had given him. \"Ah,\" he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst, \"yes . . .\" He flicked through it. \"Yes, he's right, I'm sure Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear, what's this now?\" A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and read aloud, \" 'Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately.' This is getting ridiculous. . . .\" \"A regurgitating toilet?\" \"Anti-Muggle pranksters,\" said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \"We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing — well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those — those pumbles, I think they're called — you know, the ones who mend pipes and things —\" \"Plumbers?\" \"— exactly, yes, but of course they're flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever's doing it.\" \"Will it be Aurors who catch them?\" \"Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol — ah, Harry, this is Perkins.\" A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room, panting. \"Oh Arthur!\" he said desperately, without looking at Harry. \"Thank goodness, I didn't know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not, I've just sent an owl to your home but you've obviously missed it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago —\" \"I know about the regurgitating toilet,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"No, no, it's not the toilet, it's the Potter boy's hearing — they've changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o'clock now and it's down in old Courtroom Ten —\" \"Down in old — but they told me — Merlin's beard —\" Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his chair. \"Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!\" Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley left the office at a run, Harry on his heels. \"Why have they changed the time?\" Harry said breathlessly as they hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at Perkins's desk. \"I've no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you'd missed it it would have been catastrophic!\" Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button. \"Come ON!\" The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button. \"Those courtrooms haven't been used in years,\" said Mr. Weasley angrily. \"I can't think why they're doing it down there — unless — but no . . .\" A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment, and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate. \"The Atrium,\" said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face got in. \"Morning, Arthur,\" he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend. \"Don't often see you down here. . . .\" \"Urgent business, Bode,\" said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry. \"Ah, yes,\" said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. \"Of course.\" Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable. \"Department of Mysteries,\" said the cool female voice, and left it at that. \"Quick, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps. \"Down here, down here,\" panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at a time. \"The lift doesn't even come down this far . . . why they're doing it there . . .\" They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor, which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape's dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets. The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes. \"Courtroom . . . ten . . . I think . . . we're nearly . . . yes.\" Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest. \"Go on,\" he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. \"Get in there.\" \"Aren't — aren't you coming with — ?\" \"No, no, I'm not allowed. Good luck!\" Harry's heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam's apple. He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped inside the courtroom.\n",

      "Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. Neither of them seemed to have understood what Xenophilius had said either. \"The Deathly Hallows?\" \"That's right,\" said Xenophilius. \"You haven't heard of them? I'm not surprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother's wedding,\" he nodded at Ron, \"who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows — at least, not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest.\" He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some. \"I'm sorry,\" said Harry. \"I still don't really understand.\" To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged:CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE The stuff was quite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized bogey-flavored Every Flavor Beans. \"Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,\" said Xenophilius, smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. \"But what are the Deathly Hallows?\" asked Hermione. Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. \"I assume that you are all familiar with \"The Tale of the Three Brothers'?\" Harry said, \"No,\" but Ron and Hermione both said, \"Yes.\" Xenophilius nodded gravely. \"Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers' . . . I have a copy somewhere. . . .\" He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, \"I've got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I've got it right here.\" And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. \"The original?\" inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, \"Well then, why don't you read it aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all understand.\" \"Er . . . all right,\" said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read. \"'There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight —' \" \"Midnight, our mum always told us,\" said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. \"Sorry, I just think it's a bit spookier if it's midnight!\" said Ron. \"Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,\" said Harry before he could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at the sky. \"Go on, Hermione.\" \"'In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. \"'And Death spoke to them —'\" \"Sorry,\" interjected Harry, \"but Death spoke to them?\" \"It's a fairy tale, Harry!\" \"Right, sorry. Go on.\" \"'And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. \"'So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother. \"'Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"'And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.'\" \"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?\" Harry interrupted again. \"So he can sneak up on people,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry, Hermione.\" \"'Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, and admiring Death's gifts. \"'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. \"'The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. \"'That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother's throat. \"'And so Death took the first brother for his own. \"'Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him. \"'Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her. \"'And so Death took the second brother for his own. \"'But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.'\" Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, \"Well, there you are.\" \"Sorry?\" said Hermione, sounding confused. \"Those are the Deathly Hallows,\" said Xenophilius. He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books. \"The Elder Wand,\" he said, and he drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. \"The Resurrection Stone,\" he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. \"The Cloak of Invisibility,\" he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. \"Together,\" he said, \"the Deathly Hallows.\" \"But there's no mention of the words 'Deathly Hallows' in the story,\" said Hermione. \"Well, of course not,\" said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. \"That is a children's tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.\" There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was low in the sky. \"Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,\" he said quietly. \"When you say 'master of Death' —\" said Ron. \"Master,\" said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. \"Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.\" \"But then . . . do you mean . . .\" said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, \"that you believe these objects — these Hallows — actually exist?\" Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. \"Well, of course.\" \"But,\" said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, \"Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe — ?\" \"Luna has told me all about you, young lady,\" said Xenophilius. \"You are, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded.\" \"Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,\" said Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing. \"Mr. Lovegood,\" Hermione began again. \"We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But —\" \"Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?\" Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever. She, Harry, and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment. \"Exactly,\" said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. \"None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?\" He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink. \"All right,\" said Hermione, disconcerted. \"Say the Cloak existed . . . what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?\" \"What of it?\" \"Well, how can that be real?\" \"Prove that it is not,\" said Xenophilius. Hermione looked outraged. \"But that's — I'm sorry, but that's completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn't exist? Do you expect me to get hold of — of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody's proved it doesn't exist!\"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"Yes, you could,\" said Xenophilius. \"I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.\" \"So the Elder Wand,\" said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, \"you think that exists too?\" \"Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,\" said Xenophilius. \"The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.\" \"Which is what?\" asked Harry. \"Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly master of it,\" said Xenophilius. \"Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.\" Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him. \"So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?\" asked Ron. \"Alas, who knows?\" said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. \"Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.\" There was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, \"Mr. Love-good, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?\" Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry's  memory, but he could not locate it. Peverell . . . he had heard that name before. . . . \"But you have been misleading me, young woman!\" said Xenophilius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. \"I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything — everything! — to do with the Hallows!\" \"Who are the Peverells?\" asked Ron. \"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric's Hollow,\" said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. \"Ignotus Peverell.\" \"Exactly!\" said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. \"The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus's grave is conclusive proof!\" \"Of what?\" asked Ron. \"Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!\" With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the spiral staircase. \"You will stay for dinner?\" he called, as he vanished downstairs again. \"Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy soup.\" \"Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo's,\" said Ron under his breath. Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking. \"What do you think?\" he asked Hermione.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"Oh, Harry,\" she said wearily, \"it's a pile of utter rubbish. This can't be what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.\" \"I s'pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,\" said Ron. \"You don't believe it either?\" Harry asked him. \"Nah, that story's just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn't it? 'Don't go looking for trouble, don't pick fights, don't go messing around with stuff that's best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be okay' Come to think of it,\" Ron added, \"maybe that story's why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"One of those superstitions, isn't it? 'May-born witches will marry Muggles.' 'Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.' 'Wand of elder, never prosper.' You must've heard them. My mum's full of them.\" \"Harry and I were raised by Muggles,\" Hermione reminded him. \"We were taught different superstitions.\" She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. \"I think you're right,\" she told him. \"It's just a morality tale, it's obvious which gift is best, which one you'd choose —\" The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, \"the Cloak,\" Ron said, \"the wand,\" and Harry said, \"the stone.\" They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused. \"You're supposed to say the Cloak,\" Ron told Hermione, \"but you wouldn't need to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!\" \"We've already got an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry. \"And it's helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn't noticed!\" said Hermione. \"Whereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble —\" \"Only if you shouted about it,\" argued Ron. \"Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and singing, 'I've got an unbeatable wand, come and have a go if you think you're hard enough.' As long as you kept your trap shut —\" \"Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?\" said Hermione, looking skeptical. \"You know, the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of years.\" \"There have?\" asked Harry. Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other. \"The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who's boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but — oh, it's all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people's.\" \"But how do you know,\" said Harry, \"that those wands — the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny — aren't the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?\" \"What, and they're all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?\" said Ron. Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all, ridiculous. His wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it hadCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. And if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken? \"So why would you take the stone?\" Ron asked him. \"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius . . . Mad-Eye . . . Dumbledore . . . my parents. . . .\" Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled. \"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn't want to come back, would they?\" said Harry, thinking about the tale they had just heard. \"I don't suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?\" he asked Hermione. \"No,\" she replied sadly. \"I don't think anyone except Mr. Love-good could kid themselves that's possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer's Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.\" The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: It was something like burning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings. \"What about the Cloak, though?\" said Ron slowly. \"Don't you realize, he's right? I've got so used to Harry's Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I've never heard of one like Harry's. It's infallible. We've never been spotted under it —\" \"Of course not — we're invisible when we're under it, Ron!\" \"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they're not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It's never occurred to me before, but I've heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they've got holes in.  Harry's was owned by his dad, so it's not exactly new, is it, but it's just . . . perfect!\" \"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone . . .\" As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a moment's bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to climb the stairs. \"Harry, what are you doing? I don't think you should look around when he's not here!\" But Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them all the same: Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one word, repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends . . . friends . . . friends . . . Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest window, across a bloodred sky. \"What's wrong?\" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls. \"Mr. Lovegood,\" said Harry. \"Where's Luna?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Where's Luna?\" Xenophilius halted on the top step. \"I — I've already told you. She is down at Bottom Bridge, fishing for Plimpies.\" \"So why have you only laid that tray for four?\" Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius's hands shook. \"I don't think Luna's been here for weeks,\" said Harry. \"Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn't been slept in. Where is she? And why do you keep looking out of the window?\" Xenophilius dropped the tray: The bowls bounced and smashed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew their wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the printing press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth; the press fell silent at last. Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood. \"Harry, look at this.\" He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. The front of The Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words Undesirable Number One and captioned with the reward money. \"The Quibbler's going for a new angle, then?\" Harry asked coldly, his mind working very fast. \"Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to the Ministry?\" Xenophilius licked his lips. \"They took my Luna,\" he whispered. \"Because of what I've been writing. They took my Luna and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her back to me if I — if I —\" \"Hand over Harry?\" Hermione finished for him. \"No deal,\" said Ron flatly. \"Get out of the way, we're leaving.\" Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer. \"They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave.\" He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib. \"Don't make us hurt you,\" Harry said. \"Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.\" \"HARRY!\" Hermione screamed. Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time: He launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as Xenophilius's Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart: Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard Hermione's scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fallen in, and the end of Luna's bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger to her lips. The door downstairs crashed open. \"Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?\" said a rough voice. \"Didn't I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?\" There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius. \"No . . . no . . . upstairs . . . Potter!\" \"I told you last week, Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some solid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before\" — another bang, another squeal — \"when you thought we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are Crumple\" — bang — \"Headed\" — bang — \"Snorkacks?\" \"No — no — I beg you!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"It really is Potter! Really!\" \"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!\" roared the Death Eater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius. \"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn,\" said a cool second voice, echoing up the mangled staircase. \"The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might bring the place down.\" \"You lying piece of filth,\" shouted the wizard named Selwyn. \"You've never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you'll get your girl back like this?\" \"I swear . . . I swear . . . Potter's upstairs!\" \"Homenum revelio,\" said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow. \"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn,\" said the second man sharply. \"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"Please . . . please . . . give me Luna, just let me have Luna. . . .\" \"You can have your little girl, Lovegood,\" said Selwyn, \"if you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.\" Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryingsCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE and scrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. \"Come on,\" Harry whispered, \"we've got to get out of here.\" He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried deepest: Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius's banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. \"All right,\" breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. \"Do you trust me, Harry?\" Harry nodded. \"Okay then,\" Hermione whispered, \"give me the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to put it on.\" \"Me? But Harry —\" \"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my shoulder.\" Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know what Hermione was waiting for. \"Hold tight,\" she whispered. \"Hold tight . . . any second . . .\" Xenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. \"Obliviate!\" cried Hermione, pointing her wand first into his face, then at the floor beneath them. \"Deprimo!\" She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders, Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life; there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she dragged him once more into darkness.\n",

      "They had expected to have to comb Hermione's Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Um-bridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline: MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER \"HIGH INQUISITOR\" \" 'High Inquisitor'?\" said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast slipping from his fingers. \"What does that mean?\" Hermione read aloud: \"In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \"'The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts for some time,' said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. 'He is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve.' \"This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person. \"'That's how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,' said Weasley last night. 'Dumbledore couldn't find anyone, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she's been an immediate success —' \" \"She's been a WHAT?\" said Harry loudly. \"Wait, there's more,\" said Hermione grimly. \" '— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-theground feedback about what's really happening at Hogwarts.' \"It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new position of 'Hogwarts High Inquisitor.' \"'This is an exciting new phase in the Minister's plan to get to grips with what some are calling the \"falling standards\" at Hogwarts,' said Weasley. 'The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post, and we are delighted to say that she has accepted.' \"The Ministry's new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts. \"'I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,' said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. 'Many of us with our children's best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore's eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.' \"Among those 'eccentric decisions' are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional ex-Auror 'Mad-Eye' Moody. \"Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts. \"'I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,' said a Ministry insider last night. \"Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts. \"'Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge's office,' said Madam Marchbanks. 'This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Al-bus Dumbledore.' (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks' alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17).\" Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two. \"So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed this 'Educational Decree' and forced her on us! And now he's given her the power to inspect other teachers!\" Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright. \"I can't believe this. It's outrageous. . . .\" \"I know it is,\" said Harry. He looked down at his right hand, clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin. But a grin was unfurling on Ron's face. \"What?\" said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him. \"Oh, I can't wait to see McGonagall inspected,\" said Ron happily. \"Umbridge won't know what's hit her.\" \"Well, come on,\" said Hermione, jumping up, \"we'd better get going, if she's inspecting Binns's class we don't want to be late. . . .\" But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in Snape's dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry's moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner. \"I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,\" said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, passing back their homework. \"This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.\" Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them. \"The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week's essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D's.\" He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, \"Some people got D's? Ha!\" Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information private. Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione's but it was at least blue rather than pink, like Neville's, and he delivered a flask of it to Snape's desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief. \"Well, that wasn't as bad as last week, was it?\" said Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall toward lunch. \"And the homework didn't go too badly either, did it?\" When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, \"I mean, all right, I didn't expect the top grade, not if he's marking to O.W.L. standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn't you say?\" Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat. \"Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we've got plenty of time to improve, but the grades we're getting now are a sort of baseline, aren't they? Something we can build on . . .\" They sat down together at the Gryffindor table. \"Obviously, I'd have been thrilled if I'd gotten an O —\" \"Hermione,\" said Ron sharply, \"if you want to know what grades we got, ask.\" \"I don't — I didn't mean — well, if you want to tell me —\" \"I got a P,\" said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. \"Happy?\" \"Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of,\" said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry's right. \"Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.\" \"But,\" said Hermione, \"doesn't P stand for . . .\" \" 'Poor,' yeah,\" said Lee Jordan. \"Still, better than D, isn't it? 'Dreadful'?\" Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades. \"So top grade's O for 'Outstanding,' \" she was saying, \"and then there's A —\" \"No, E,\" George corrected her, \"E for 'Exceeds Expectations.' And I've always thought Fred and I should've got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.\" They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, \"So after E, it's A for 'Acceptable,' and that's the last pass grade, isn't it?\" \"Yep,\" said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth, and swallowing it whole. \"Then you get P for 'Poor' \" — Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration — \"and D for 'Dreadful.' \" \"And then T,\" George reminded him. \"T?\" asked Hermione, looking appalled. \"Even lower than a D? What on earth does that stand for?\" \" 'Troll,' \" said George promptly. Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received T's in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on. \"You lot had an inspected lesson yet?\" Fred asked them. \"No,\" said Hermione at once, \"have you?\" \"Just now, before lunch,\" said George. \"Charms.\" \"What was it like?\" Harry and Hermione asked together. Fred shrugged. \"Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard. You know what Flitwick's like, he treated her like a guest, didn't seem to bother him at all. She didn't say much. Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it.\" \"I can't see old Flitwick getting marked down,\" said George, \"he usually gets everyone through their exams all right.\" \"Who've you got this afternoon?\" Fred asked Harry. \"Trelawney —\" \"A T if ever I saw one —\" \"— and Umbridge herself.\" \"Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,\" said George. \"Angelina'll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.\" But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out Dream Oracles, look round. \"Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,\" said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile. \"You received my note, I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?\" Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney's seat. She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin. Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses. \"We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,\" she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly. \"Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each other's latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.\" She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Um-bridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati's most recent dream. Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney's wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book. \"Think of a dream, quick,\" he told Ron, \"in case the old toad comes our way.\" \"I did it last time,\" Ron protested, \"it's your turn, you tell me one.\" \"Oh, I dunno . . .\" said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. \"Let's say I dreamed I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that'll do. . . .\" Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle. \"Okay, we've got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject . . . would that be 'drowning' or 'cauldron' or 'Snape'?\" \"It doesn't matter, pick any of them,\" said Harry, chancing a glance behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney's shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary. \"What night did you dream this again?\" Ron said, immersed in calculations. \"I dunno, last night, whenever you like,\" Harry told him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out. \"Now,\" said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, \"you've been in this post how long, exactly?\" Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, \"Nearly sixteen years.\" \"Quite a period,\" said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. \"So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?\" \"That's right,\" said Professor Trelawney shortly. Professor Umbridge made another note. \"And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?\" \"Yes,\" said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher. Another note on the clipboard. \"But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?\" \"These things often skip — er — three generations,\" said Professor Trelawney. Professor Umbridge's toadlike smile widened. \"Of course,\" she said sweetly, making yet another note. \"Well, if you could just predict something for me, then?\" She looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Professor Trelawney had stiffened as though unable to believe her ears. \"I don't understand you,\" said Professor Trelawney, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck. \"I'd like you to make a prediction for me,\" said Professor Umbridge very clearly. Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height, her beads and bangles clinking. \"The Inner Eye does not See upon command!\" she said in scandalized tones. \"I see,\" said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her clipboard. \"I — but — but . . . wait!\" said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. \"I . . . I think I do see something . . . something that concerns you. . . . Why, I sense something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril . . .\" Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Um-bridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised. \"I am afraid . . . I am afraid that you are in grave danger!\" Professor Trelawney finished dramatically. There was a pause. Professor Umbridge's eyebrows were still raised. \"Right,\" she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more. \"Well, if that's really the best you can do . . .\" She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron's eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: They both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney's side — until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that was. \"Well?\" she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry's nose, uncharacteristically brisk. \"Let me see the start you've made on your dream diary, please.\" And by the time she had interpreted Harry's dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic toward her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later. She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell. \"Wands away,\" she instructed them all smilingly, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags. \"As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, 'Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation.' There will be no need to talk.\" Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year's lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again. Professor Umbridge had noticed too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione, she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, \"What is it this time, Miss Granger?\" \"I've already read chapter two,\" said Hermione. \"Well then, proceed to chapter three.\" \"I've read that too. I've read the whole book.\" Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly. \"Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen.\" \"He says that counterjinxes are improperly named,\" said Hermione promptly. \"He says 'counterjinx' is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.\" Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows, and Harry knew she was impressed against her will. \"But I disagree,\" Hermione continued. Professor Umbridge's eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder. \"You disagree?\" \"Yes, I do,\" said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the class's attention. \"Mr. Slinkhard doesn't like jinxes, does he? But I think they can be very useful when they're used defensively.\" \"Oh, you do, do you?\" said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. \"Well, I'm afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard's opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.\" \"But —\" Hermione began. \"That is enough,\" said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. \"Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House.\" There was an outbreak of muttering at this. \"What for?\" said Harry angrily. \"Don't you get involved!\" Hermione whispered urgently to him. \"For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,\" said Professor Umbridge smoothly. \"I am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but as none of them — with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects — would have passed a Ministry inspection —\" \"Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,\" said Harry loudly, \"there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.\" This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then — \"I think another week's detentions would do you some good, Mr. Potter,\" said Umbridge sleekly. The cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and by the following morning, it was bleeding again. He did not complain during the evening's detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter. The very worst part of this second week's worth of detentions was, just as George had predicted, Angelina's reaction. She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table. \"Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But Professor — he's gone and landed himself in detention again —\" \"What's this, Potter?\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry. \"Detention? From whom?\" \"From Professor Umbridge,\" muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall's beady, square-framed eyes. \"Are you telling me,\" she said, lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, \"that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge's class again?\" \"Yes,\" Harry muttered, speaking to the floor. \"Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for serious trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But — what? Professor, no!\" Harry said, furious at this injustice. \"I'm already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well?\" \"Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you what- soever!\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. \"No, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy!\" She strode back toward the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which Harry flung himself onto the bench beside Ron, fuming. \"She's taken points off Gryffindor because I'm having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?\" \"I know, mate,\" said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto Harry's plate, \"she's bang out of order.\" Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing. \"You think McGonagall was right, do you?\" said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione's face. \"I wish she hadn't taken points from you, but I think she's right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,\" said Hermione's voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech. Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger; Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head. \"Excellent,\" whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. \"Let's see Umbridge get what she deserves.\" Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there. \"That will do,\" she said and silence fell immediately. \"Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown, please take this box of mice — don't be silly, girl, they won't hurt you — and hand one to each student —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back Harry's essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A. \"Right then, everyone, listen closely — Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention — most of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell. Today we shall be —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Professor Umbridge. \"Yes?\" said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line. \"I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec —\" \"Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,\" said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks of glee. \"As I was saying, today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell —\" \"Hem, hem.\" \"I wonder,\" said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, \"how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.\" Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more. \"As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So — you know the incantation, let me see what you can do. . . .\" \"How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge!\" Harry said to Ron under his voice, but he was grinning; his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated. Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought that Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however, take many more notes while she sat in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim expression on her face. \"Well, it's a start,\" said Ron, holding up a long, wriggling mouse tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around. As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teacher's desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop. \"How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\" Professor Um-bridge asked. \"Thirty-nine years this December,\" said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut. Professor Umbridge made a note. \"Very well,\" she said, \"you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days' time.\" \"I can hardly wait,\" said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off toward the door. \"Hurry up, you three,\" she added, sweeping Harry, Ron, and Hermione before her. Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return. He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong. When they walked down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"You do not usually take this class, is that correct?\" Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living twigs. \"Quite correct,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet. \"I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.\" Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry. \"Hmm,\" said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly, \"I wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid's very extended leave of absence?\" Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly. \" 'Fraid I can't,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. \"Don't know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks teaching work, accepted — that's as much as I know. Well . . . shall I get started then?\" \"Yes, please do,\" said Professor Umbridge, scribbling upon her clipboard. Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among the students, questioning them on magical creatures. Most people were able to answer well and Harry's spirits lifted somewhat; at least the class was not letting Hagrid down. \"Overall,\" said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor GrubblyPlank's side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, \"how do you, as a temporary member of staff — an objective outsider, I suppose  you might say — how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management?\" \"Oh, yes, Dumbledore's excellent,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily. \"No, I'm very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.\" Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on, \"And what are you planning to cover with this class this year — assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return?\" \"Oh, I'll take them through the creatures that most often come up in O.W.L.,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"Not much left to do — they've studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we'd cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know. . . .\" \"Well, you seem to know what you're doing, at any rate,\" said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis she put on \"you\" and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle: \"Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class?\" Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question. \"That was me,\" he said. \"I was slashed by a hippogriff.\" \"A hippogriff?\" said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically. \"Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,\" said Harry angrily. Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harry's direction. \"Another night's detention, I think,\" she said softly. \"Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that's all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.\" \"Jolly good,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Um-bridge set off back across the lawn to the castle. It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge's office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical. \"Here,\" she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward him, \"soak your hand in that, it's a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.\" Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down. \"Thanks,\" he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks's ears with his left hand. \"I still reckon you should complain about this,\" said Ron in a low voice. \"No,\" said Harry flatly. \"McGonagall would go nuts if she knew —\" \"Yeah, she probably would,\" said Harry. \"And how long d'you reckon it'd take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?\" Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way. \"She's an awful woman,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \"Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we've got to do something about her.\" \"I suggested poison,\" said Ron grimly. \"No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any defense from her at all,\" said Hermione. \"Well, what can we do about that?\" said Ron, yawning. \" 'S too late, isn't it? She got the job, she's here to stay, Fudge'll make sure of that.\" \"Well,\" said Hermione tentatively. \"You know, I was thinking today. . . .\" She shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, \"I was thinking that — maybe the time's come when we should just — just do it ourselves.\" \"Do what ourselves?\" said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles. \"Well — learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves,\" said Hermione. \"Come off it,\" groaned Ron. \"You want us to do extra work? D'you realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week?\" \"But this is much more important than homework!\" said Hermione. Harry and Ron goggled at her. \"I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework,\" said Ron. \"Don't be silly, of course there is!\" said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in her. \"It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting out there. It's about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don't learn anything for a whole year —\" \"We can't do much by ourselves,\" said Ron in a defeated voice. \"I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose —\" \"No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,\" said Hermione. \"We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we're going wrong.\" \"If you're talking about Lupin . . .\" Harry began. \"No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,\" said Hermione. \"He's too busy with the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that's not nearly often enough.\" \"Who, then?\" said Harry, frowning at her. Hermione heaved a very deep sigh. \"Isn't it obvious?\" she said. \"I'm talking about you, Harry.\" There was a moment's silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered. \"About me what?\" said Harry. \"I'm talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.\" Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry's consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated. He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, \"That's an idea.\" \"What's an idea?\" said Harry. \"You,\" said Ron. \"Teaching us to do it.\" \"But . . .\" Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg. \"But I'm not a teacher, I can't —\" \"Harry, you're the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione. \"Me?\" said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. \"No I'm not, you've beaten me in every test —\" \"Actually, I haven't,\" said Hermione coolly. \"You beat me in our third year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I'm not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you've done!\" \"How d'you mean?\" \"You know what, I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,\" Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. \"Let's think,\" he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. \"Uh . . . first year — you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.\" \"But that was luck,\" said Harry, \"that wasn't skill —\" \"Second year,\" Ron interrupted, \"you killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle.\" \"Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up I —\" \"Third year,\" said Ron, louder still, \"you fought off about a hundred dementors at once —\" \"You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't —\" \"Last year,\" Ron said, almost shouting now, \"you fought off YouKnow-Who again —\" \"Listen to me!\" said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. \"Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck — I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I didn't plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help —\" Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn't even sure why he was feeling so angry. \"Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn't I?\" he said heatedly. \"I know what went on, all right? And I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because — because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right — but I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing — STOP LAUGHING!\" The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn't remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and Hermione's smiles had vanished. \"You don't know what it's like! You — neither of you — you've never had to face him, have you? You think it's just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you're in class or something? The whole time you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own — your own brain or guts or whatever — like you can think straight when you know you're about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die — they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that — and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up — you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me —\" \"We weren't saying anything like that, mate,\" said Ron, looking aghast. \"We weren't having a go at Diggory, we didn't — you've got the wrong end of the —\" He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken. \"Harry,\" she said timidly, \"don't you see? This . . . this is exactly why we need you. . . . We need to know what it's r-really like . . . facing him . . . facing V-Voldemort.\" It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort's name, and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry. Still breathing hard, he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence. \"Well . . . think about it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"Please?\" Harry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed of his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was agreeing to. Hermione stood up. \"Well, I'm off to bed,\" she said in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it. \"Erm . . . 'night.\" Ron had gotten to his feet too. \"Coming?\" he said awkwardly to Harry. \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"In . . . in a minute. I'll just clear this up.\" He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left. \"Reparo,\" Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china. They flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl. He was suddenly so tired that he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead he got to his feet and followed Ron upstairs. His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors, and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again.\n",

      "Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle. The front door had remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood. \"What sort of time do you call this?\" \"I'm really sorry — I had to go out for something important —\" \"Well, the password changed at midnight, so you'll just have to sleep in the corridor, won't you?\" \"You're joking!\" said Harry. \"Why did it have to change at midnight?\" \"That's the way it is,\" said the Fat Lady. \"If you're angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he's the one who's tightened security.\" \"Fantastic,\" said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. \"Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he's the one who wanted me to —\" \"He is here,\" said a voice behind Harry. \"Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.\" Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff. \"I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,\" said Nick. \"He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.\" \"Where is he?\" said Harry, his heart leaping. \"Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it's a favorite pastime of his —\" \"Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!\" \"Oh — in his office,\" said Nick. \"I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in —\" \"Yeah, he has,\" said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him. \"Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password's still 'tapeworm'!\" But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying \"toffee &eacute;clairs\" to Dumbledore's gargoyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. \"Enter,\" said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore's office,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows. \"Good gracious, Harry,\" said Dumbledore in surprise. \"To what do I owe this very late pleasure?\" \"Sir — I've got it. I've got the memory from Slughorn.\" Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. \"Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!\" All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn's memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve. \"And now,\" said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. \"Now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .\" Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn's office many years before. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple. And there were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo's gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, \"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\" \"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you,\" said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. \"I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\" Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. \"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn't, and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite —\" Several of the boys tittered again. \"— I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts at the Ministry.\" Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader. \"I don't know that politics would suit me, sir,\" he said when the laughter had died away. \"I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing.\" A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader's famous ancestor. \"Nonsense,\" said Slughorn briskly, \"couldn't be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around. \"Good gracious, is it that time already? You'd better get going, boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\" One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there. \"Look sharp, Tom, you don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect . . .\" \"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\" \"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. . . .\" \"Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?\" Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass. \"Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?\" But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork. \"Not exactly, sir,\" said Riddle. \"I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.\" \"No . . . well . . . you'd be hard-pushed to find a book at Hog-warts that'll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,\" said Slughorn. \"But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you — sorry, I mean, if you can't tell me, obviously — I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could — so I just thought I'd ask —\" It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. \"Well,\" said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, \"well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.\" \"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir,\" said Riddle. His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. \"Well, you split your soul, you see,\" said Slughorn, \"and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form . . .\" Slughorn's face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before: \"I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive.\" \". . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.\" But Riddle's hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. \"How do you split your soul?\" \"Well,\" said Slughorn uncomfortably, \"you must understandCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.\" \"But how do you do it?\" \"By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —\" \"Encase? But how — ?\" \"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!\" said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \"Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer?\" \"No, sir, of course not,\" said Riddle quickly. \"I'm sorry . . . I didn't mean to offend . . .\" \"Not at all, not at all, not offended,\" said Slughorn gruffly. \"It's natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle. \"What I don't understand, though — just out of curiosity — I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven — ?\" \"Merlin's beard, Tom!\" yelped Slughorn. \"Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .\" Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all. \"Of course,\" he muttered, \"this is all hypothetical, what we're discussing, isn't it? All academic . . .\" \"Yes, sir, of course,\" said Riddle quickly. \"But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I've told — that's to say, what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore's particularly fierce about it. . . .\" \"I won't say a word, sir,\" said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . . \"Thank you, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Let us go. . . .\" When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak. \"I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore at last. \"It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. . . .\" Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. \"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \"You think he succeeded then, sir?\" asked Harry. \"He made a Horcrux? And that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\" \"A bit . . . or more,\" said Dumbledore. \"You heard Voldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know — as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.\" Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thoughts, and then said, \"Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\" \"Where?\" asked Harry \"How?\" \"You handed it to me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"The diary, Riddle's diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\" \"I don't understand, sir,\" said Harry. \"Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. . . . a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. \"What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.\" \"I still don't understand,\" said Harry. \"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again.\" \"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted,\" said Harry. \"He wanted people to know he was Slytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time.\" \"Quite correct,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blas&eacute; about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. \"The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made — or been planning to make — more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. \"Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. 'I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.' That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody,' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring toCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil' . . .\" \"So he's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?\" said Harry. \"Why couldn't he make a Sorcerer's Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?\" \"Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,\" said Dumbledore. \"But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort. \"While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain their immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see . . . or as close to immortal as any man can be. \"But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: 'Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most powerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\" \"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or invisible —\" \"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in his body.\" \"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\" \"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been — forgive me the lack of seemly modesty — for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \"But how did you find it?\" \"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts' house. It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. \"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\" \"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be old tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .\" \"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\" \"The diary wasn't that special.\" \"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the  Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.\" \"So, the other Horcruxes?\" said Harry. \"Do you think you know what they are, sir?\" \"I can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\" \"The locket!\" said Harry loudly. \"Hufflepuff 's cup!\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\" Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. \"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hog-warts, sir?\" said Harry. \"To try and find something from one of the other founders?\" \"My thoughts precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.\" \"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry, counting on his fingers. \"Unless he got both?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?\" \"The snake?\" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes?\" \"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the intention of killing you. \"He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. \"As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort's mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\" \"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dumbledore, bowing his head. \"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school?\" \"Correct,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have been looking for a very long time. I think . . . perhaps . . . I may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.\" \"And if you do,\" said Harry quickly, \"can I come with you and help get rid of it?\" Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \"Yes, I think so.\" \"I can?\" said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \"I think you have earned that right.\" Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore's decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. \"Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?\" Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. \"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do.CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\" \"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hog-warts?\" \"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemort's say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary. \"No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius's fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master's soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemort's fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\" Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \"So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?\" \"Yes, I think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.\" \"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —\" \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\" \"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\" \"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means — love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. \"Yes — just love,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!\" \"But it comes to the same —\" \"No, it doesn't!\" said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, \"You are setting too much store by the prophecy!\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \"But,\" spluttered Harry, \"but you said the prophecy means —\" \"If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?\" \"But,\" said Harry, bewildered, \"but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other —\" \"Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\" \"But —\" \"It is essential that you understand this!\" said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. \"By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort's followers!\" \"Of course I haven't!\" said Harry indignantly. \"He killed my mum and dad!\" \"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! \"But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.\" \"But, sir,\" said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, \"it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or —\" \"Got to?\" said Dumbledore. \"Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\" Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. \"I'd want him finished,\" said Harry quietly. \"And I'd want to do it.\" \"Of course you would!\" cried Dumbledore. \"You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that —\" \"That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\" said Harry. \"Yes.\" But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world.\n",

      "He — he sent me this,\" Hermione said, holding out the letter. Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read. \"They can't do this,\" said Harry. \"They can't. Buckbeak isn't dangerous.\" \"Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it,\" said Hermione, wiping her eyes. \"You know what he's like. They're a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there always is. Only I can't see any hope. . . . Nothing will have changed.\" \"Yeah, it will,\" said Ron fiercely. \"You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help.\" \"Oh, Ron!\" Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away. \"Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers . . . ,\" she sobbed. \"Oh — well — he was old,\" said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him. \"And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.\" The safety measures imposed on the students since Black's second break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons. He seemed numb with shock at the verdict. \"S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in black robes an' I kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them dates yeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an' said his bit, and the Committee jus' did exac'ly what he told 'em. . . .\" \"There's still the appeal!\" said Ron fiercely. \"Don't give up yet, we're working on it!\" They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class. Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively. \"S'no good, Ron,\" said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps. \"That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket. I'm jus' gonna make sure the rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had. I owe him that. . . .\" Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried in his handkerchief. \"Look at him blubber!\" Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors, listening. \"Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?\" said Malfoy. \"And he's supposed to be our teacher!\" Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got there first — SMACK! She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again. \"Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you evil —\" \"Hermione!\" said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung it back. \"Get off, Ron!\" Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered. \"C'mon,\" Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons. \"Hermione!\" Ron said again, sounding both stunned and impressed. \"Harry, you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final!\" Hermione said shrilly. \"You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin wins!\" \"We're due in Charms,\" said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. \"We'd better go.\" They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's classroom. \"You're late, boys!\" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened the classroom door. \"Come along, quickly, wands out, we're experimenting with Cheering Charms today, we've already divided into pairs —\" Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron looked behind him. \"Where's Hermione gone?\" Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door. \"That's weird,\" said Harry, staring at Ron. \"Maybe — maybe she went to the bathroom or something?\" But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson. \"She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too,\" said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly — the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment. Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried. \"You don't think Malfoy did something to her?\" Ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (\"Flibbertigibbet\"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room. Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake. \"Wh — what?\" said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly around. \"Is it time to go? W — which lesson have we got now? \"Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes,\" said Harry. \"Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?\" \"What? Oh no!\" Hermione squeaked. \"I forgot to go to Charms!\" \"But how could you forget?\" said Harry. \"You were with us till we were right outside the classroom!\" \"I don't believe it!\" Hermione wailed. \"Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!\" \"You know what, Hermione?\" said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. \"I reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much.\" \"No, I'm not!\" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. \"I just made a mistake, that's all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry. . . . I'll see you in Divination!\" Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor  Trelawney's classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harassed. \"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!\" Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table. \"I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term,\" Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby. \"Don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry,\" Harry muttered back. \"I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.\" \"Good day to you!\" said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal ball. \"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around. \"The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.\" Hermione snorted. \"Well, honestly . . . 'the fates have informed her' . . . who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!\" she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs. It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them, as her face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had not. \"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,\" she said dreamily. \"I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes\" — Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise — \"so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will See before the end of the class.\" And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as \"this is stupid\" kept drifting across it. It didn't help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting. \"Seen anything yet?\" Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour's quiet crystal gazing. \"Yeah, there's a burn on this table,\" said Ron, pointing. \"Someone's spilled their candle.\" \"This is such a waste of time,\" Hermione hissed. \"I could be practicing something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms —\" Professor Trelawney rustled past. \"Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?\" she murmured over the clinking of her bangles. \"I don't need help,\" Ron whispered. \"It's obvious what this means. There's going to be loads of fog tonight.\" Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing. \"Now, really!\" said Professor Trelawney as everyone's heads turned in their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. \"You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!\" She approached their table and peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He was sure he knew what was coming — \"There is something here!\" Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering her face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses. \"Something moving . . . but what is it?\" Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, including his Firebolt, that it wasn't good news, whatever it was. And sure enough — \"My dear . . . ,\" Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. \"It is here, plainer than ever before . . . my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer . . . the Gr —\" \"Oh, for goodness' sake!\" said Hermione loudly. \"Not that ridiculous Grim again!\" Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione's face. Parvati whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable anger. \"I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class, my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don't remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.\" There was a moment's silence. Then — \"Fine!\" said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into her bag. \"Fine!\" she repeated, swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. \"I give up! I'm leaving!\" And to the whole class's amazement, Hermione strode over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight. It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turned abruptly from Harry and Ron's table, breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her. \"Ooooo!\" said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. \"Oooooo, Professor Trelawney, I've just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn't you? Didn't you, Professor? 'Around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever!' You said it ages ago, Professor!\" Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile. \"Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us. One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs. . . . The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know. . . .\" Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that Professor Trelawney could join their table instead. \"Some day Hermione's having, eh?\" Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed. \"Yeah . . .\" Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? The last thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch final drawing ever nearer. The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and he wasn't the only one. \"Call this a holiday!\" Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon. \"The exams are ages away, what're they playing at?\" But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she was taking more subjects than anybody else. She was usually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin's under her eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears. Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal. When he wasn't doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so absorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks. Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quid-ditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) that they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. It also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points. \"So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up,\" Wood told Harry constantly. \"Only if we're more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You've got that, haven't you? You must catch the Snitch only if we're —\" \"I KNOW, OLIVER!\" Harry yelled. The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming  match. Gryffindor hadn't won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron's second oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment. Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buck-beak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school. Never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears. Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn't walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people. Wood had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his Firebolt's safety than his own. When he wasn't flying it, he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still there. All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the night before the match. Even Hermione had put down her books. \"I can't work, I can't concentrate,\" she said nervously. There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred's and George's jokes. Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he did, he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomach. \"You're going to be fine,\" Hermione told him, though she looked positively terrified. \"You've got a Firebolt!\" said Ron. \"Yeah . . . ,\" said Harry, his stomach writhing. It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, \"Team! Bed!\" Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood was yelling, \"Where were you? We had to use Neville instead!\" Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth, when he realized he had forgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and woke with a start. It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn't taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went to pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window. The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless and innocent-looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfect. Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn. Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn't be the Grim — not now — not right before the match — He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute's frantic searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now. . . . It wasn't the Grim at all . . . it was a cat. . . . Harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only Crookshanks. . . . Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too. And just then, it emerged — a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it be an omen of Harry's death? \"Ron!\" Harry hissed. \"Ron! Wake up!\" \"Huh?\" \"I need you to tell me if you can see something!\" \"S'all dark, Harry,\" Ron muttered thickly. \"What're you on about?\" \"Down here —\" Harry looked quickly back out of the window. Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren't there. Where had they gone? A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again. Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn't help grinning broadly as he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual. Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching nothing himself. Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again. \"Good luck, Harry!\" called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing. \"Okay — no wind to speak of — sun's a bit bright, that could  impair your vision, watch out for it — ground's fairly hard, good, that'll give us a fast kickoff —\" Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally, they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn. \"Locker rooms,\" said Wood tersely. None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he'd eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at all, Wood was saying, \"Okay, it's time, let's go —\" They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Three-quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like \"GO GRYFFINDOR!\" and \"LIONS FOR THE CUP!\" Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile. \"And here are the Gryffindors!\" yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as commentator as usual. \"Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years —\" Lee's comments were drowned by a tide of \"boos\" from the Slytherin end. \"And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He's made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill —\" More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person on the Slytherin team; the rest of them were enormous. \"Captains, shake hands!\" said Madam Hooch. Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other's hand very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other's fingers. \"Mount your brooms!\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three . . . two . . . one . . .\" The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch. \"And it's Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of Gryffindor with the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no — Quaffle intercepted by Warring-ton, Warrington of Slytherin tearing up the field — WHAM! — nice Bludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it's caught by — Johnson, Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina — nice swerve around Montague — duck, Angelina, that's a Bludger! — SHE SCORES! TEN&ndash;ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\" Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight — \"OUCH!\" Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her. \"Sorry!\" said Flint as the crowd below booed. \"Sorry, didn't see her!\" A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater's club at the back of Flint's head. Flint's nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed. \"That will do!\" shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between them. \"Penalty shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!\" \"Come off it, Miss!\" howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Alicia flew forward to take the penalty. \"Come on, Alicia!\" yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd. \"YES! SHE'S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY&ndash;ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely, fly forward to take the Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched. \" 'Course, Wood's a superb Keeper!\" Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint waited for Madam Hooch's whistle. \"Superb! Very difficult to pass — very difficult indeed — YES! I DON'T BELIEVE IT! HE'S SAVED IT!\" Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still making sure he caught every word of Lee's commentary. It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty points up — \"Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession — no! — Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she's streaking up the field — THAT WAS DELIBERATE!\" Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie,  and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cartwheeled in the air, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle. Madam Hooch's whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the Slytherin Seeker. \"THIRTY&ndash;ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING —\" \"Jordan, if you can't commentate in an unbiased way — !\" \"I'm telling it like it is, Professor!\" Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn't catch it yet — and if Malfoy saw it — Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Fire-bolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end — it worked. Malfoy went haring after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there. . . . WHOOSH. One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry's right ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again — WHOOSH. The second Bludger grazed Harry's elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was closing in. Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him, clubs raised — He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch. \"Ha haaa!\" yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching their heads. \"Too bad, boys! You'll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt! And it's Gryffindor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside her — poke him in the eye, Angelina! — it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke — oh no — Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal posts, come on now, Wood, save — !\" But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him. \"Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won't happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession —\" It was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he'd thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the score forty-ten to Gryffindor. The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it — once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead — Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred's and George's absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after the other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded. Madam Hooch was beside herself. \"YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING AREA!\" she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. \"Gryffindor penalty!\" And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal — seventy-ten. The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse — Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him. And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him. Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down — Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back. \"You —\" Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn't reach — Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he'd wanted to do — the Snitch had disappeared again. \"Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I've never seen such tactics!\" Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his Nimbus Two Thousand and One. \"YOU CHEATING SCUM!\" Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall's reach. \"YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B —\" Professor McGonagall didn't even bother to tell him off. She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoy's direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was shouting furiously. Alicia took Gryffindor's penalty, but she was so angry she missed by several feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy's foul on Harry, were being spurred on to greater heights. \"Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal — Montague scores —\" Lee groaned. \"Seventy-twenty to Gryffindor. . . .\" Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other. Harry wasn't going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch. . . . \"Get out of it, Potter!\" Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found Harry blocking him. \"Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina, COME ON!\" Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins. \"AAAAAAARRRGH!\" They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina's way was clear. \"SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty points to twenty!\" Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field. And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face — there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer — Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead — \"Go! Go! Go!\" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfoy — Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him — he was at Malfoy's ankles — he was level — Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy's arm out of the way and — \"YES!\" He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers. Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina's, Alicia's, and Katie's voices, \"We've won the Cup! We've won the Cup!\" Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth. Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him. Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into the light, he saw Hagrid, plastered with crimson rosettes — \"Yeh beat 'em, Harry, yeh beat 'em! Wait till I tell Buckbeak!\" There was Percy, jumping up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup. If only there had been a dementor around. . . . As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world's best Patronus.\n",

      "The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross. \"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid. \"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\" She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. \"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room. \"The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hog-warts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. \"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\" Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. \"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor Mc-Gonagall. \"Please wait quietly.\" She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \"How exactly do they sort us into Houses?\" he asked Ron. \"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\" Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed. \"What the — ?\" He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —\" \"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?\" A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. Nobody answered. \"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\" A few people nodded mutely. \"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old House, you know.\" \"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.\" Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. \"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\" Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \"It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\" It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens. Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house. Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, But don't judge on what you see, I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don't be afraid! And don't get in a flap! You're in safe hands (though I have none) For I'm a Thinking Cap!\" The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. \"So we've just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\" Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a  lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. \"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\" A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment's pause — \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat. The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. \"Bones, Susan!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \"Boot, Terry!\" \"RAVENCLAW!\" The table second from the left clapped this time; several Raven-claws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. \"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling. \"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. \"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. \"Granger, Hermione!\" Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned. A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\" Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\" Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. There weren't many people left now. \"Moon\" . . . , \"Nott\" . . . , \"Parkinson\" . . . , then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" . . . , then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" . . . , and then, at last — \"Potter, Harry!\" As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. \"Potter, did she say?\" \"The Harry Potter?\" The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. \"Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?\" Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. \"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you're sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the  Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. And now there were only four people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. \"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. \"Welcome!\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \"Thank you!\" He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. \"Is he — a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly. \"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\" Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. \"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. \"Can't you — ?\" \"I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\" \"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you — you're Nearly Headless Nick!\" \"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —\" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. \"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\" Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted. \"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So — new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable — he's the Slytherin ghost.\" Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements. \"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest. \"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as be- fore. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate &eacute;clairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding . . . As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. \"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\" The others laughed. \"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron. \"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\" On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult —\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —\"). Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead. \"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head. \"What is it?\" asked Percy. \"N-nothing.\" The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look — a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all. \"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy. \"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to — everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\" Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \"Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\" Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. \"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch. \"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\" Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \"He's not serious?\" he muttered to Percy. \"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere — the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\" \"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed. Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. \"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\" And the school bellowed: \"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they're bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot, Just do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.\" Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\" The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more  staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. \"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves — show yourself.\" A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. \"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\" There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\" He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy. Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\" At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. \"Great food, isn't it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets.\" Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.\n",

      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along. \"Fits, doesn't it?\" he said. \"Remember what Malfoy said on the train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew each other. They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup. . . . I'll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he's going to be feeling really stupid now, isn't he? Didn't work, did it? You only got a scratch! Come here — I'll do it —\" Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he wasCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE flying around and around Harry's head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg. \"There's no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?\" Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. \"You know what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I'm serious.\" Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron. \"Harry's got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,\" she said seriously. \"If that was the first task, I hate to think what's coming next.\" \"Right little ray of sunshine, aren't you?\" said Ron. \"You and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime.\" He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual — Harry hadn't been able to resist giving Sirius a blow-byblow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said, \"Well, we'd better get downstairs for your surprise party, Harry — Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now.\" Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every  surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster's Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail's head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire. Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn't believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he'd gotten through the first task, and he wouldn't have to face the second one for three months. \"Blimey, this is heavy,\" said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. \"Open it, Harry, go on! Let's just see what's inside it!\" \"He's supposed to work out the clue on his own,\" Hermione said swiftly. \"It's in the tournament rules. . . .\" \"I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,\" Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily. \"Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!\" several people echoed. Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open. It was hollow and completely empty — but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw. \"Shut it!\" Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"What was that?\" said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again. \"Sounded like a banshee. . . . Maybe you've got to get past one of those next, Harry!\" \"It was someone being tortured!\" said Neville, who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor. \"You're going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!\" \"Don't be a prat, Neville, that's illegal,\" said George. \"They wouldn't use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing . . . maybe you've got to attack him while he's in the shower, Harry.\" \"Want a jam tart, Hermione?\" said Fred. Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her. Fred grinned. \"It's all right,\" he said. \"I haven't done anything to them. It's the custard creams you've got to watch —\" Neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it out. Fred laughed. \"Just my little joke, Neville. . . .\" Hermione took a jam tart. Then she said, \"Did you get all this from the kitchens, Fred?\" \"Yep,\" said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched squeak and imitated a house-elf. \"'Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!' They're dead helpful . . . get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.\" \"How do you get in there?\" Hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice. \"Easy,\" said Fred, \"concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and —\" He stopped and looked suspiciously at her. \"Why?\" \"Nothing,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you?\" said George. \"Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?\" Several people chortled. Hermione didn't answer. \"Don't you go upsetting them and telling them they've got to take clothes and salaries!\" said Fred warningly \"You'll put them off their cooking!\" Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary. \"Oh — sorry, Neville!\" Fred shouted over all the laughter. \"I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed —\" Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He even joined in laughing. \"Canary Creams!\" Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. \"George and I invented them — seven Sickles each, a bargain!\" It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he pulled the curtains of his four-poster shut, Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point . . . they were all right, really, dragons. . . . The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty though the castle always was in winter, Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowingCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime's horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the corner of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them. \"I'm not sure whether they hibernate or not,\" Hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. \"Thought we'd jus' try an' see if they fancied a kip . . . we'll jus' settle 'em down in these boxes. . . .\" There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful, scuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets. \"We'll jus' lead 'em in here,\" Hagrid said, \"an' put the lids on, and we'll see what happens.\" But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, \"Don' panic, now, don' panic!\" while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class — Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead — had fled into Hagrid's cabin through the  back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left. \"Don' frighten him, now!\" Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. \"Jus' try an' slip the rope 'round his sting, so he won' hurt any o' the others!\" \"Yeah, we wouldn't want that!\" Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid's cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks. \"Well, well, well . . . this does look like fun.\" Rita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid's garden fence, looking in at the mayhem. She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and her crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm. Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby. \"Who're you?\" Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt's sting and tightened it. \"Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,\" Rita replied, beaming at him. Her gold teeth glinted. \"Thought Dumbledore said you weren' allowed inside the school anymore,\" said Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE Rita acted as though she hadn't heard what Hagrid had said. \"What are these fascinating creatures called?\" she asked, beaming still more widely. \"Blast-Ended Skrewts,\" grunted Hagrid. \"Really?\" said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. \"I've never heard of them before . . . where do they come from?\" Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid's wild black beard, and his heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from? Hermione, who seemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly, \"They're very interesting, aren't they? Aren't they, Harry?\" \"What? Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting,\" said Harry as she stepped on his foot. \"Ah, you're here, Harry!\" said Rita Skeeter as she looked around. \"So you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him. \"Lovely,\" said Rita. \"Really lovely. Been teaching long?\" she added to Hagrid. Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear. \"This is o'ny me second year,\" said Hagrid. \"Lovely. . . I don't suppose you'd like to give an interview, would you? Share some of your experience of magical creatures? The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday, as I'm sure you know. We could feature these — er — Bang-Ended Scoots.\" \"Blast-Ended Skrewts,\" Hagrid said eagerly. \"Er — yeah, why not?\" Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week. Then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson. \"Well, good-bye, Harry!\" Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron and Hermione. \"Until Friday night, then, Hagrid!\" \"She'll twist everything he says,\" Harry said under his breath. \"Just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or anything,\" said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another — it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do. \"Hagrid's been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore's never sacked him,\" said Ron consolingly. \"Worst that can happen is Hagrid'll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best.\" Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch. Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again. Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"I would think,\" she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance, \"that some of us\" — she stared very meaningfully at Harry — \"might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night. As I sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its crystalline depths . . . and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?\" \"An ugly old bat in outsize specs?\" Ron muttered under his breath. Harry fought hard to keep his face straight. \"Death, my dears.\" Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking horrified. \"Yes,\" said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, \"it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower . . . ever lower over the castle. . . .\" She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and obviously. \"It'd be a bit more impressive if she hadn't done it about eighty times before,\" Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath Professor Trelawney's room. \"But if I'd dropped dead every time she's told me I'm going to, I'd be a medical miracle.\" \"You'd be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,\" said Ron, chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly. \"At least we didn't get homework. I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not working when she is. . . .\" But Hermione wasn't at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward. The only person in there was Viktor Krum. Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in whispers with Harry whether he should ask for an autograph — but then Ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea. \"Wonder where she's got to?\" Ron said as he and Harry went back to Gryffindor Tower. \"Dunno . . . balderdash.\" But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced Hermione's arrival. \"Harry!\" she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady stared down at her, eyebrows raised). \"Harry, you've got to come — you've got to come, the most amazing thing's happened — please —\" She seized Harry's arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor. \"What's the matter?\" Harry said. \"I'll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick —\" Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued. \"Okay,\" Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up. \"Oh don't mind me!\" the Fat Lady called irritably after them. \"Don't apologize for bothering me! I'll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?\" \"Yeah, thanks!\" Ron shouted over his shoulder. \"Hermione, where are we going?\" Harry asked, after she had ledCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. \"You'll see, you'll see in a minute!\" said Hermione excitedly. She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry's names. Harry had never been through here before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape's dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food. \"Oh hang on . . .\" said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor. \"Wait a minute, Hermione. . . .\" \"What?\" She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face. \"I know what this is about,\" said Harry. He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl. \"Hermione!\" said Ron, cottoning on. \"You're trying to rope us into that spew stuff again!\" \"No, no, I'm not!\" she said hastily. \"And it's not spew, Ron —\" \"Changed the name, have you?\" said Ron, frowning at her. \"What are we now, then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I'm not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work, I'm not doing it —\" \"I'm not asking you to!\" Hermione said impatiently. \"I came down here just now, to talk to them all, and I found — oh come on, Harry, I want to show you!\" She seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl, stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear. It began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside. He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing, \"Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!\" Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break. \"D-Dobby?\" Harry gasped. \"It is Dobby, sir, it is!\" squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel. \"Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!\" Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet — all except the clothes, which were very different. When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinnedCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of what looked like children's soccer shorts, and odd socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one Harry had removed from his own foot and tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free. The other was covered in pink and orange stripes. \"Dobby, what're you doing here?\" Harry said in amazement. \"Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!\" Dobby squealed excitedly. \"Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!\" \"Winky?\" said Harry. \"She's here too?\" \"Yes, sir, yes!\" said Dobby, and he seized Harry's hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above. At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming, bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing the same uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as Winky's had been, like a toga. Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed. \"Winky, sir!\" he said. Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her  large ears. However, while every one of Dobby's strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brand-new, Winky was plainly not taking care of her clothes at all. There were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt. \"Hello, Winky,\" said Harry. Winky's lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the Quidditch World Cup. \"Oh dear,\" said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. \"Winky, don't cry, please don't . . .\" But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at Harry. \"Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?\" he squeaked loudly, over Winky's sobs. \"Er — yeah, okay,\" said Harry. Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits. \"Good service!\" Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated. \"How long have you been here, Dobby?\" Harry asked as Dobby handed around the tea. \"Only a week, Harry Potter, sir!\" said Dobby happily. \"Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed —\"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE At this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-tomato of a nose dribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to stem the flow. \"Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!\" Dobby squeaked. \"But Dobby hasn't found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying now!\" The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said, \"Good for you, Dobby!\" \"Thank you, miss!\" said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. \"But most wizards doesn't want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. 'That's not the point of a house-elf,' they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby's face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid, Harry Potter. . . . Dobby likes being free!\" The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as though he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her crying. \"And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky has been freed too, sir!\" said Dobby delightedly. At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay face-down on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference. Dobby continued with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky's screeches. \"And then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir! 'Why doesn't Dobby and Winky find work together?' Dobby says. 'Where is there enough work for two house-elves?' says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir! Hogwarts! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor Dumbledore took us on!\" Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again. \"And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!\" \"That's not very much!\" Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over Winky's continued screaming and fist-beating. \"Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,\" said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, \"but Dobby beat him down, miss. . . . Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn't wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.\" \"And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?\" Hermione asked kindly. If she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious. \"Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!\" she squeaked. \"Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!\" \"Ashamed?\" said Hermione blankly. \"But — Winky, come on! It's Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn't do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you —\"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn't hear a word, and screeched, \"You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr. Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!\" \"Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,\" squeaked Dobby confidentially. \"Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won't do it.\" \"Can't house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?\" Harry asked. \"Oh no, sir, no,\" said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. \" 'Tis part of the house-elf's enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We upholds the family's honor, and we never speaks ill of them — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to — to —\" Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent forward. Dobby whispered, \"He said we is free to call him a — a barmy old codger if we likes, sir!\" Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle. \"But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,\" he said, talking normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped. \"Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him.\" \"But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?\" Harry asked him, grinning. A slightly fearful look came into Dobby's immense eyes. \"Dobby — Dobby could,\" he said doubtfully. He squared his small shoulders. \"Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards!\" Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by his own daring — then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, \"Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!\" Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table. \"Thank you, Harry Potter, thank you,\" said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his head. \"You just need a bit of practice,\" Harry said. \"Practice!\" squealed Winky furiously. \"You is ought to be ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!\" \"They isn't my masters anymore, Winky!\" said Dobby defiantly. \"Dobby doesn't care what they think anymore!\" \"Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!\" moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face once more. \"My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her . . . oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the shame!\" She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled. \"Winky,\" said Hermione firmly, \"I'm quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you. We've seen him, you know —\" \"You is seeing my master?\" said Winky breathlessly, raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at Hermione. \"You is seeing him here at Hogwarts?\" \"Yes,\" said Hermione, \"he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"Mr. Bagman comes too?\" squeaked Winky, and to Harry's great surprise (and Ron's and Hermione's too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again. \"Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My master isn't liking him, oh no, not at all!\" \"Bagman — bad?\" said Harry. \"Oh yes,\" Winky said, nodding her head furiously. \"My master is telling Winky some things! But Winky is not saying . . . Winky — Winky keeps her master's secrets. . . .\" She dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into her skirt, \"Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more! They couldn't get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages. \"Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!\" he said happily, pointing at his bare chest. \"Tell you what, Dobby,\" said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, \"I'll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her. You don't mind maroon, do you?\" Dobby was delighted. \"We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,\" Ron told him, \"but it'll go well with your tea cozy.\" As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies. \"Thanks a lot!\" Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say good night. \"See you, Dobby!\" \"Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?\" Dobby asked tentatively. \" 'Course you can,\" said Harry, and Dobby beamed. \"You know what?\" said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. \"All these years I've been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens — well, it's not exactly difficult, is it? They can't wait to give it away!\" \"I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know,\" said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. \"Dobby coming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it'll dawn on them that they want that too!\" \"Let's hope they don't look too closely at Winky,\" said Harry. \"Oh she'll cheer up,\" said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful. \"Once the shock's worn off, and she's got used to Hog-warts, she'll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man.\" \"She seems to love him,\" said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake). \"Doesn't think much of Bagman, though, does she?\" said Harry. \"Wonder what Crouch says at home about him?\" \"Probably says he's not a very good Head of Department,\" said Hermione, \"and let's face it . . . he's got a point, hasn't he?\" \"I'd still rather work for him than old Crouch,\" said Ron. \"At least Bagman's got a sense of humor.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"Don't let Percy hear you saying that,\" Hermione said, smiling slightly. \"Yeah, well, Percy wouldn't want to work for anyone with a sense of humor, would he?\" said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair. \"Percy wouldn't recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby's tea cozy.\"\n",

      "Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts. Ginny gave a gasp of horror. \"To me, Potter,\" repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up. Harry's insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped and outnumbered two to one. \"To me,\" said Malfoy yet again. \"Where's Sirius?\" Harry said. Several of the Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry's left said triumphantly, \"The Dark Lord always knows!\" \"Always,\" echoed Malfoy softly. \"Now, give me the prophecy, Potter.\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" mimicked the woman to his left. She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were &bull; 781 &bull; CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry's eyes. \"You've got him,\" said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row. \"He's here. I know he is.\" \"The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo,\" said the woman in a horrible, mock-baby voice. Harry felt Ron stir beside him. \"Don't do anything,\" he muttered. \"Not yet —\" The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter. \"You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!\" \"Oh, you don't know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,\" said Malfoy softly. \"He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.\" \"I know Sirius is here,\" said Harry, though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly. \"I know you've got him!\" More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman still laughed loudest of all. \"It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.\" \"Go on, then,\" said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry's stomach tightened. If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all. . . . But the Death Eaters did not strike. \"Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,\" said Malfoy coolly. It was Harry's turn to laugh. \"Yeah, right!\" he said. \"I give you this — prophecy, is it? And you'll just let us skip off home, will you?\" The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked, \"Accio Proph —\" Harry was just ready for her. He shouted \"Protego!\" before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it. \"Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,\" she said, her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. \"Very well, then —\" \"I TOLD YOU, NO!\" Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. \"If you smash it — !\" Harry's mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get them all out of this alive, make sure that none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity . . . The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow. \"You need more persuasion?\" she said, her chest rising and falling rapidly. \"Very well — take the smallest one,\" she ordered the Death Eaters beside her. \"Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I'll do it.\" Harry felt the others close in around Ginny. He stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest. \"You'll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,\" he told Bellatrix. \"I don't think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he?\" She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth. \"So,\" said Harry, \"what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway?\"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville's arm was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking. He could feel one of the other's quickened breath on the back of his head. He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his mind was blank. \"What kind of prophecy?\" repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from her face. \"You jest, Harry Potter.\" \"Nope, not jesting,\" said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape. \"How come Voldemort wants it?\" Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses. \"You dare speak his name?\" whispered Bellatrix. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. \"Yeah, I've got no problem saying Vol —\" \"Shut your mouth!\" Bellatrix shrieked. \"You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood's tongue, you dare —\" \"Did you know he's a half-blood too?\" said Harry recklessly. Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. \"Voldemort? Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle — or has he been telling you lot he's pureblood?\" \"STUPEF —\" \"NO!\" A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange's wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. His spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered. Two figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak. Their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments  of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix's shouts. \". . . at the Solstice will come a new . . .\" said the figure of an old, bearded man. \"DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!\" \"He dared — he dares —\" shrieked Bellatrix incoherently. \"— He stands there — filthy half-blood —\" \"WAIT UNTIL WE'VE GOT THE PROPHECY!\" bawled Malfoy. \". . . and none will come after . . .\" said the figure of a young woman. The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however, given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the others. \"You haven't told me what's so special about this prophecy I'm supposed to be handing over,\" he said, playing for time. He moved his foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else's. \"Do not play games with us, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"I'm not playing games,\" said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone's toes and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermione's. \"What?\" she whispered. \"Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?\" said Malfoy sneeringly. \"I — what?\" said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan. \"What about my scar?\" \"What?\" whispered Hermione more urgently behind him. \"Can this be?\" said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of theirCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, \"Smash shelves —\" \"Dumbledore never told you?\" Malfoy repeated. \"Well, this explains why you didn't come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why —\" \"— when I say go —\" \"— you didn't come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording. . . .\" \"Did he?\" said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. \"So he wanted me to come and get it, did he? Why?\" \"Why?\" Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. \"Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him.\" \"And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?\" \"About both of you, Potter, about both of you . . . Haven't you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?\" Harry stared into the slitted eyeholes through which Malfoy's gray eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry's parents had died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand? \"Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?\" he said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust. \"And he's made me come and get it for him? Why couldn't he come and get it himself?\" \"Get it himself?\" shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter. \"The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?\" \"So he's got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?\" said Harry. \"Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?\" \"Very good, Potter, very good . . .\" said Malfoy slowly. \"But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell —\" \"NOW!\" yelled Harry. Five different voices behind him bellowed \"REDUCTO!\" Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor — \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of Hermione's robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres — Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout \"Stupefy!\" and the hand released him at once. They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione's voice urging Neville on. The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them — \"Colloportus!\" gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise. \"Where — where are the others?\" gasped Harry. He had thought that Ron, Luna, and Ginny had been ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there. \"They must have gone the wrong way!\" whispered Hermione, terror in her face. \"Listen!\" whispered Neville. Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed. Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar: \"Leave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care for Nott's injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson, come back here, we need to organize! We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary — Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right — Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight ahead — Macnair and Avery, through here — Rookwood, over there — Mulciber, come with me!\" \"What do we do?\" Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot. \"Well, we don't stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,\" said Harry. \"Let's get away from this door. . . .\" They ran, quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, toward the exit into the  circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut. \"Stand aside!\" said a rough voice. \"Alohomora!\" As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione, and Neville dived under desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters' robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly. \"They might've run straight through to the hall,\" said the rough voice. \"Check under the desks,\" said another. Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend. Poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted, \"STUPEFY !\" A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry's spell and now pointed his own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim. \"Avada —\" Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, \"EXPELLIARMUS !\" Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front and Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck at what he had done. \"Get out of the way, Harry!\" yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage. Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted, \"STUPEFY !\"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater's shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses. The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered — The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned — his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, \"STUP —\" \"STUPEFY !\" screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest; he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind. \"Accio Wand !\" cried Hermione. Harry's wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him. \"Thanks,\" he said, \"right, let's get out of —\" \"Look out!\" said Neville, horrified, staring at the Death Eater's head in the bell jar. All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck. They were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man's head. It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull, his cheeks smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz. . . . A baby's head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again. But even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again, thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin. . . . \"It's time,\" said Hermione in an awestruck voice. \"Time . . .\" The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together again, it began to shrink back to babyhood once more. . . . There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream. \"RON?\" Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. \"GINNY? LUNA?\" \"Harry!\" Hermione screamed. The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby's head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing Harry, who ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm. \"You can't hurt a baby!\" There was no time to argue the point. Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position. \"Come on!\" he said again, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them, they took off for the door that stood ajar at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway. They had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room toward them. Veering left he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the door behind them. \"Collo —\" began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled, \"IMPEDIMENTA!\" Harry, Hermione, and Neville were all knocked backward off their feet. Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry's head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes, and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react. \"WE'VE GOT HIM!\" yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry, \"IN AN OFFICE OFF —\" \"Silencio!\" cried Hermione, and the man's voice was extinguished. He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward, facedown onto the rug at Harry's feet, stiff as a board and unable to move at all. \"Well done, Ha —\" But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of what looked like purple flame. It passed right across Hermione's chest; she gave a tiny \"oh!\" as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where she lay motionless. \"HERMIONE!\" Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly toward her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville's head as he emerged — his foot broke Neville's wand in two and connected with his face — Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts. Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harry's hand, to himself, then at Hermione. Though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been clearer: Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her. . . . \"Like you won't kill us all the moment I hand it over anyway!\" said Harry. A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly. He had one hand on Hermione's shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don't let her be dead, don't let her be dead, it's my fault if she's dead. . . . \"Whaddever you do, Harry,\" said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, \"don'd gib it to him!\" Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him. Harry seized his chance: \"PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!\" The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it, and he toppled forward across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch. \"Hermione,\" Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again. \"Hermione, wake up. . . .\" \"Whaddid he do to her?\" said Neville, crawling out from under the desk again to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose. \"I dunno. . . .\" Neville groped for Hermione's wrist. \"Dat's a pulse, Harry, I'b sure id is. . . .\" Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed. \"She's alive?\" \"Yeah, I dink so. . . .\" There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sounds of CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby Death Eater in the next room. \"Neville, we're not far from the exit,\" Harry whispered. \"We're right next to that circular room. . . . If we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I'll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift. . . . Then you could find someone. . . . Raise the alarm . . .\" \"And whad are you going do do?\" said Neville, mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry. \"I've got to find the others,\" said Harry. \"Well, I'b going do find dem wid you,\" said Neville firmly. \"But Hermione —\" \"We'll dake her wid us,\" said Neville firmly. \"I'll carry her — you're bedder at fighding dem dan I ab —\" He stood up and seized one of Hermione's arms, glared at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione's limp form over Neville's shoulders. \"Wait,\" said Harry, snatching up Hermione's wand from the floor and shoving it into Nevilles hand, \"you'd better take this. . . .\" Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly toward the door. \"My gran's going do kill be,\" said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, \"dat was by dad's old wand. . . .\" Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter, and repair itself on the wall behind them. \"He's never going to notice us,\" he whispered. \"C'mon . . . keep close behind me. . . .\" They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forward, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione's weight. The door of the Time Room swung shut behind them, and the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of Harry's head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart Harry saw that Hermione's fiery crosses had faded from the doors. \"So which way d'you reck — ?\" But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it. \"Ron!\" croaked Harry, dashing toward them. \"Ginny — are you all — ?\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the front of Harry's robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes. \"There you are. . . . Ha ha ha . . . You look funny, Harry. . . . You're all messed up. . . . Ron's face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry's robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow. \"Ginny?\" Harry said fearfully. \"What happened?\" But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle. \"I think her ankle's broken, I heard something crack,\" whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt. \"Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark —\" \"Harry, we saw Uranus up close!\" said Ron, still giggling feebly. \"Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus — ha ha ha —\"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron's mouth and burst. \"Anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny's foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but . . .\" Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed. \"And what about Ron?\" said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry's robes. \"I don't know what they hit him with,\" said Luna sadly, \"but he's gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all. . . .\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, pulling Harry's ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, \"you know who this girl is, Harry? She's Loony . . . Loony Lovegood . . . ha ha ha . . .\" \"We've got to get out of here,\" said Harry firmly. \"Luna, can you help Ginny?\" \"Yes,\" said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, putting an arm around Ginny's waist and pulling her up. \"It's only my ankle, I can do it myself!\" said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Ron's arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dudley's. He looked around: They had a one-in-twelve chance of getting the exit right the first time — He heaved Ron toward a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped into the hall, led by Bellatrix Lestrange. \"There they are!\" she shrieked. Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him, and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione. They were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix. \"Colloportus!\" shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side. \"It doesn't matter!\" said a man's voice. \"There are other ways in — WE'VE GOT THEM, THEY'RE HERE!\" Harry spun around. They were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first. \"Luna — Neville — help me!\" The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door. \"Colloportus!\" There were footsteps running along behind the doors; every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered. Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall — then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry, \"Collo — aaaaaaaaargh . . .\" He turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione. \"Get Potter!\" shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him. He dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy — \"Hey!\" said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward Harry, giggling. \"Hey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn't that weird, Harry?\" \"Ron, get out of the way, get down —\" But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank. \"Honest, Harry, they're brains — look — Accio Brain!\" The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny, and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish. For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared toward Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film — \"Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it —\" said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards. \"Harry, come and touch it, bet it's weird —\" \"RON, NO!\" Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands. The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron's arms like ropes. \"Harry, look what's happen — no — no, I don't like it — no, stop — stop —\" But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron's chest now. He tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus's body. \"Diffindo!\" yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds. \"Harry, it'll suffocate him!\" screamed Ginny, immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor — then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater's wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious. \"STUBEFY !\" shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermione's wand at the oncoming Death Eaters. \"STUBEFY, STUBEFY !\" But nothing happened — one of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that left craters in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange sprinted right at him. Holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others. It seemed to have worked. They streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come. Inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron — find some way of releasing him — he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish — He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters' laughter. He looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending toward him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench toward him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him. The prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sights. The back of his legs hit something solid; he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed backward onto it. The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the full Body-Bind, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry's face. \"Potter, your race is run,\" drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his mask. \"Now hand me the prophecy like a good boy. . . .\" \"Let — let the others go, and I'll give it to you!\" said Harry desperately.CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE A few of the Death Eaters laughed. \"You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,\" said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure. \"You see, there are ten of us and only one of you . . . or hasn't Dumbledore ever taught you how to count?\" \"He's dot alone!\" shouted a voice from above them. \"He's still god be!\" Harry's heart sank. Neville was scrambling down the stone benches toward them, Hermione's wand held fast in his trembling hand. \"Neville — no — go back to Ron —\" \"STUBEFY !\" Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn, \"STUBEFY ! STUBE —\" One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed. \"It's Longbottom, isn't it?\" sneered Lucius Malfoy. \"Well, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause. . . . Your death will not come as a great shock. . . .\" \"Longbottom?\" repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face. \"Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy. . . .\" \"I DOE YOU HAB!\" roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captor's encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, \"Someone Stun him!\" \"No, no, no,\" said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. \"No, let's see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents. . . . Unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy —\" \"DON'D GIB ID DO DEM!\" roared Neville, who seemed beside himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor, her wand raised. \"DON'D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!\" Bellatrix raised her wand. \"Crucio!\" Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony. \"That was just a taster!\" said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that Neville's screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned and gazed up at Harry. \"Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!\" Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy was hot with the heat from his clutching hand as he held it out. Malfoy jumped forward to take it. Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley. Malfoy turned and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville. \"Are you okay?\" he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads. \"Yes,\" said Neville, trying to pull himself up. \"And Ron?\" \"I dink he's all right — he was still fighding the brain when I left —\" The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville's hand had been seconds before. Both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor. \"Give it to me,\" growled a voice in his ear, \"give me the prophecy —\" The man was pressing so tightly on Harry's windpipe that he could not breathe — through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away. Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix — nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. . . . He turned his wand backward toward the man's side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man's free hand was groping toward the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy — \"AARGH!\" Neville had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione's wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater's mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped, \"STUPEFY !\" The Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off. It was Macnair, Buckbeak's would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot. \"Thanks!\" Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs. Then Harry's foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped — for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, then saw Moody's magic eye spinning away across the floor. Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee. \"Tarantallegra!\" he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again. \"Now, Potter —\" He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, \"Protego!\" Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville's jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell. Dolohov raised his wand again. \"Accio Proph —\" Sirius hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder, and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry's fingers but he had managed to cling to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand tips — Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Once again, Dolohov's arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backward, landing with a crash on his back. \"Nice one!\" shouted Sirius, forcing Harry's head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew toward them. \"Now I want you to get out of —\" They both ducked again. A jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius; across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat, and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back toward the fray. \"Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville, and run!\" Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew over Harry's head as he launched himself toward Neville — \"Can you stand?\" he bellowed in Neville's ear, as Neville's legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably. \"Put your arm round my neck —\" Neville did so — Harry heaved — Neville's legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them. Both fell backward, Neville's legsCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE waving wildly like an overturned beetle's, Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed. \"The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!\" snarled Lucius Malfoy's voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy's wand pressing hard between his ribs. \"No — get — off — me . . . Neville — catch it!\" Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, \"Impedimenta!\" Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them. \"Harry, round up the others and GO!\" Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone steps. Neville's legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight. Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step — A spell hit the stone bench at Harry's heel. It crumbled away and he fell back to the step below: Neville sank to the ground, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and thrust the prophecy into his pocket. \"Come on!\" said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville's robes. \"Just try and push with your legs —\" He gave another stupendous heave and Neville's robes tore all along the left seam — the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and before either of them could catch it, one of Neville's floundering feet kicked it. It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with  hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness. \"Harry, I'b sorry!\" cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder, \"I'b so sorry, Harry, I didn'd bean do —\" \"It doesn't matter!\" Harry shouted. \"Just try and stand, let's get out of —\" \"Dubbledore!\" said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry's shoulder. \"What?\" \"DUBBLEDORE!\" Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body — they were saved. Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thought of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there. There were yells; one of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore's spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line — Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of red light: He was laughing at her. \"Come on, you can do better than that!\" he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room. The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest. The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock.CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore turned to the dais too. It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall. His body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch. . . . And Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather's wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place. Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange's triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing — Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he would reappear from the other side any second. . . . But Sirius did not reappear. \"SIRIUS!\" Harry yelled, \"SIRIUS!\" He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out again. . . . But as he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back. \"There's nothing you can do, Harry —\" \"Get him, save him, he's only just gone through!\" \"It's too late, Harry —\" \"We can still reach him —\" Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go. . . . \"There's nothing you can do, Harry . . . nothing. . . . He's gone.\"\n",

      "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\" Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing . . .\" Dudley's birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he  wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\" Don't ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put  together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\" Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty . . . thirty . . .\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction. Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. \"What about what's-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \". . . and leave him in the car. . . .\" \"That cars new, he's not sitting in it alone. . . .\" Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying — it had been years since he'd really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I . . . don't . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly . . .\" But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \". . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don't,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" The snake nodded vigorously. \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see — so you've never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He  couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n",

      "quo;S TALE Harry sprinted up to the boys' dormitory to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map from his trunk; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls' dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats. \"Well, it's cold out there!\" she said defensively, as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently. They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the cloak — Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing — then, moving slowly and cautiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Norris. They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like \"Weasley Is Our King.\" They crept across the entrance hall and then out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid's chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two'S TALE jostling and bumping along behind him, and they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door; when Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside. \"Hagrid, it's us!\" Harry called through the keyhole. \"Shoulda known!\" said a gruff voice. They beamed at one another under the cloak; they could tell that Hagrid's voice was pleased. \"Bin home three seconds . . . Out the way, Fang . . . Out the way, yeh dozy dog . . .\" The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open, and Hagrid's head appeared in the gap. Hermione screamed. \"Merlin's beard, keep it down!\" said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. \"Under that cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!\" \"I'm sorry!\" Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them. \"I just — oh, Hagrid !\" \"It's nuthin', it's nuthin'!\" said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror. Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood, and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple-and-black bruises. There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleeding, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home; a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man and three times as broad, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it. \"What happened to you?\" Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick their faces. \"Told yeh, nuthin',\" said Hagrid firmly. \"Want a cuppa?\" \"Come off it,\" said Ron, \"you're in a right state!\" \"I'm tellin' yeh, I'm fine,\" said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing. \"Blimey, it's good ter see you three again — had good summers, did yeh?\" \"Hagrid, you've been attacked!\" said Ron. \"Fer the las' time, it's nuthin'!\" said Hagrid firmly. \"Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?\" Ron demanded. \"You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,\" said Hermione anxiously. \"Some of those cuts look nasty.\" \"I'm dealin' with it, all righ'?\" said Hagrid repressively. He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire. \"You're not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?\" said Ron, leaning in for a closer look. \"It looks poisonous.\" \"It's s'posed ter look like that, it's dragon meat,\" Hagrid said. \"An' I didn' get it ter eat.\" He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face. Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction. \"Tha's better. It helps with the stingin', yeh know.\" \"So are you going to tell us what's happened to you?\" Harry asked. \"Can', Harry. Top secret. More'n me job's worth ter tell yeh that.\" \"Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione quietly. Hagrid's fingers slipped on the dragon steak, and it slid squelchily onto his chest. \"Giants?\" said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face. \"Who said anythin' abou' giants? 'S TALE Who yeh bin talkin' to? Who's told yeh what I've — who's said I've bin — eh?\" \"We guessed,\" said Hermione apologetically. \"Oh, yeh did, did yeh?\" said Hagrid, fixing her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak. \"It was kind of . . . obvious,\" said Ron. Harry nodded. Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak onto the table again and strode back to the kettle, which was now whistling. \"Never known kids like you three fer knowin' more'n yeh oughta,\" he muttered, splashing boiling water into three of his bucket-shaped mugs. \"An' I'm not complimentin' yeh, neither. Nosy, some'd call it. Interferin'.\" But his beard twitched. \"So you have been to look for giants?\" said Harry, grinning as he sat down at the table. Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his steak again, and slapped it back over his face. \"Yeah, all righ',\" he grunted, \"I have.\" \"And you found them?\" said Hermione in a hushed voice. \"Well, they're not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,\" said Hagrid. \"Pretty big, see.\" \"Where are they?\" said Ron. \"Mountains,\" said Hagrid unhelpfully. \"So why don't Muggles — ?\" \"They do,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"O'ny their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin' accidents, aren' they?\" He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising. \"Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you've been up to!\" said Ron. \"Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors —\" Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea, and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft splat, onto the floor. \"Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?\" growled Hagrid. \"Didn't you know?\" Hermione asked him, wide-eyed. \"I don' know anything that's been happenin' since I left. I was on a secret mission, wasn' I, didn' wan' owls followin' me all over the place — ruddy dementors! Yeh're not serious?\" \"Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me —\" \"WHAT?\" \"— and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first.\" \"You were expelled?\" \"Tell us about your summer and I'll tell you about mine.\" Hagrid glared at him through his one open eye. Harry looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on his face. \"Oh, all righ',\" Hagrid said in a resigned voice. He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang's mouth. \"Oh, Hagrid, don't, it's not hygien —\" Hermione began, but Ha-grid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye. He took another fortifying gulp of tea and then said, \"Well, we set off righ' after term ended —\" \"Madame Maxime went with you, then?\" Hermione interjected. \"Yeah, tha's right,\" said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak. \"Yeah, it was jus' the pair of us. An' I'll tell yeh this, she's not afraid of roughin' it, Olympe. Yeh know, she's a fine, well-dressed woman, an' knowin' where we was goin' I wondered 'ow she'd feel abou' clamberin' over boulders an' sleepin' in caves an' tha', bu' she never complained once.\"'S TALE \"You knew where you were going?\" Harry asked. \"You knew where the giants were?\" \"Well, Dumbledore knew, an' he told us,\" said Hagrid. \"Are they hidden?\" asked Ron. \"Is it a secret, where they are?\" \"Not really,\" said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head. \"It's jus' that mos' wizards aren' bothered where they are, s' long as it's a good long way away. But where they are's very difficult ter get ter, fer humans anyway, so we needed Dumbledore's instructions. Took us abou' a month ter get there —\" \"A month?\" said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time. \"But — why couldn't you just grab a Portkey or something?\" There was an odd expression in Hagrid's unobscured eye as he squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying. \"We're bein' watched, Ron,\" he said gruffly. \"What d'you mean?\" \"Yeh don' understand,\" said Hagrid. \"The Ministry's keepin' an eye on Dumbledore an' anyone they reckon's in league with him, an' —\" \"We know about that,\" said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest of Hagrid's story. \"We know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore —\" \"So you couldn't use magic to get there?\" asked Ron, looking thunderstruck. \"You had to act like Muggles all the way?\" \"Well, not exactly all the way,\" said Hagrid cagily. \"We jus' had ter be careful, 'cause Olympe an' me, we stick out a bit —\" Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea. \"— so we're not hard ter follow. We was pretendin' we was goin' on holiday together, so we got inter France an' we made like we was headin' fer where Olympe's school is, 'cause we knew we was bein' tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, 'cause I'm not really s'posed ter use magic an' we knew the Ministry'd be lookin' fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin' us the slip round abou' Dee-John —\" \"Ooooh, Dijon?\" said Hermione excitedly. \"I've been there on holiday, did you see — ?\" She fell silent at the look on Ron's face. \"We chanced a bit o' magic after that, and it wasn' a bad journey. Ran inter a couple o' mad trolls on the Polish border, an' I had a sligh' disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha', couldn't'a bin smoother. \"An' then we reached the place, an' we started trekkin' up through the mountains, lookin' fer signs of 'em . . . \"We had ter lay off the magic once we got near 'em. Partly 'cause they don' like wizards an' we didn' want ter put their backs up too soon, and partly 'cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an' all. Said it was odds on he'd sent a messenger off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin' attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.\" Hagrid paused for a long draft of tea. \"Go on!\" said Harry urgently. \"Found 'em,\" said Hagrid baldly. \"Went over a ridge one nigh' an' there they was, spread ou' underneath us. Little fires burnin' below an' huge shadows . . . It was like watchin' bits o' the mountain movin'.\" \"How big are they?\" asked Ron in a hushed voice. \" 'Bout twenty feet,\" said Hagrid casually. \"Some o' the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.\" \"And how many were there?\" asked Harry. \"I reckon abou' seventy or eighty,\" said Hagrid. \"Is that all?\" said Hermione. \"Yep,\" said Hagrid sadly, \"eighty left, an' there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff'rent tribes from all over the world. But they've bin dyin' out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o' course, but 'S TALE mostly they killed each other, an' now they're dyin' out faster than ever. They're not made ter live bunched up together like tha'. Dumbledore says it's our fault, it was the wizards who forced 'em to go an' made 'em live a good long way from us an' they had no choice but ter stick together fer their own protection.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"you saw them and then what?\" \"Well, we waited till morning, didn' want ter go sneakin' up on 'em in the dark, fer our own safety,\" said Hagrid. \" 'Bout three in the mornin' they fell asleep jus' where they was sittin'. We didn' dare sleep. Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of 'em woke up an' came up where we were, an' fer another, the snorin' was unbelievable. Caused an avalanche near mornin'. \"Anyway, once it was light we wen' down ter see 'em.\" \"Just like that?\" said Ron, looking awestruck. \"You just walked right into a giant camp?\" \"Well, Dumbledore'd told us how ter do it,\" said Hagrid. \"Give the Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.\" \"Give the what gifts?\" asked Harry. \"Oh, the Gurg — means the chief.\" \"How could you tell which one was the Gurg?\" asked Ron. Hagrid grunted in amusement. \"No problem,\" he said. \"He was the biggest, the ugliest, an' the laziest. Sittin' there waitin' ter be brought food by the others. Dead goats an' such like. Name o' Karkus. I'd put him at twenty-two, twenty-three feet, an' the weight of a couple o' bull elephants. Skin like rhino hide an' all.\" \"And you just walked up to him?\" said Hermione breathlessly. \"Well . . . down ter him, where he was lyin' in the valley. They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an' Karkus was lyin' by the lake roarin' at the others ter feed him an' his wife. Olympe an' I went down the mountainside —\" \"But didn't they try and kill you when they saw you?\" asked Ron incredulously. \"It was def'nitely on some of their minds,\" said Hagrid, shrugging, \"but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an' keep our eyes on the Gurg an' ignore the others. So tha's what we did. An' the rest of 'em went quiet an' watched us pass an' we got right up ter Karkus's feet an' we bowed an' put our present down in front o' him.\" \"What do you give a giant?\" asked Ron eagerly. \"Food?\" \"Nah, he can get food all righ' fer himself,\" said Hagrid. \"We took him magic. Giants like magic, jus' don't like us usin' it against 'em. Anyway, that firs' day we gave him a branch o' Gubraithian fire.\" Hermione said \"wow\" softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement. \"A branch of — ?\" \"Everlasting fire,\" said Hermione irritably, \"you ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick's mentioned it at least twice in class!\" \"Well anyway,\" said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, \"Dumbledore'd bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn' somethin' any wizard could do, an' so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus's feet and says, 'A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.' \" \"And what did Karkus say?\" asked Harry eagerly. \"Nothin',\" said Hagrid. \"Didn' speak English.\" \"You're kidding!\" \"Didn' matter,\" said Hagrid imperturbably, \"Dumbledore had warned us tha' migh' happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o' giants who knew our lingo an' they translated fer us.\" \"And did he like the present?\" asked Ron. \"Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,\" said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler'S TALE side to his swollen eye. \"Very pleased. So then I said, 'Albus Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift.' \" \"Why couldn't you speak to them that day?\" asked Hermione. \"Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,\" said Hagrid. \"Let 'em see we kept our promises. We'll come back tomorrow with another present, an' then we do come back with another present — gives a good impression, see? An' gives them time ter test out the firs' present an' find out it's a good one, an' get 'em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus — overload 'em with information an' they'll kill yeh jus' to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an' went off an' found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in, an' the followin' mornin' we went back an' this time we found Karkus sittin' up waitin' fer us lookin' all eager.\" \"And you talked to him?\" \"Oh yeah. Firs' we presented him with a nice battle helmet — goblin-made an' indestructible, yeh know — an' then we sat down an' we talked.\" \"What did he say?\" \"Not much,\" said Hagrid. \"Listened mostly. But there were good signs. He'd heard o' Dumbledore, heard he'd argued against the killin' of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int'rested in what Dumbledore had ter say. An' a few o' the others, 'specially the ones who had some English, they gathered round an' listened too. We were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next day with another present. \"But that night it all wen' wrong.\" \"What d'you mean?\" said Ron quickly. \"Well, like I say, they're not meant ter live together, giants,\" said Hagrid sadly. \"Not in big groups like that. They can' help themselves, they half kill each other every few weeks. The men fight each other an'  the women fight each other, the remnants of the old tribes fight each other, an' that's even without squabbles over food an' the best fires an' sleepin' spots. Yeh'd think, seein' as how their whole race is abou' finished, they'd lay off each other, but . . .\" Hagrid sighed deeply \"That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin' down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn' believe the noise. An' when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an' his head was lyin' at the bottom o' the lake.\" \"Whose head?\" gasped Hermione. \"Karkus's,\" said Hagrid heavily. \"There was a new Gurg, Golgomath.\" He sighed deeply. \"Well, we hadn' bargained on a new Gurg two days after we'd made friendly contact with the firs' one, an' we had a funny feelin' Golgomath wouldn' be so keen ter listen to us, but we had ter try.\" \"You went to speak to him?\" asked Ron incredulously. \"After you'd watched him rip off another giant's head?\" \" 'Course we did,\" said Hagrid, \"we hadn' gone all that way ter give up after two days! We wen' down with the next present we'd meant ter give ter Karkus. \"I knew it was no go before I'd opened me mouth. He was sitting there wearin' Karkus's helmet, leerin' at us as we got nearer. He's massive, one o' the biggest ones there. Black hair an' matchin' teeth an' a necklace o' bones. Human-lookin' bones, some of 'em. Well, I gave it a go — held out a great roll o' dragon skin — an' said A gift fer the Gurg of the giants —' Nex' thing I knew, I was hangin' upside down in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me.\" Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth. \"How did you get out of that?\" asked Harry. \"Wouldn'ta done if Olympe hadn' bin there,\" said Hagrid. \"She pulled out her wand an' did some o' the fastes' spellwork I've ever seen.'S TALE Ruddy marvelous. Hit the two holdin' me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an' they dropped me straightaway — bu' we were in trouble then, 'cause we'd used magic against 'em, an' that's what giants hate abou' wizards. We had ter leg it an' we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again.\" \"Blimey, Hagrid,\" said Ron quietly. \"So how come it's taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?\" asked Hermione. \"We didn' leave after three days!\" said Hagrid, looking outraged. \"Dumbledore was relyin' on us!\" \"But you've just said there was no way you could go back!\" \"Not by daylight, we couldn', no. We just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o' days lyin' low up in the cave an' watchin'. An' wha' we saw wasn' good.\" \"Did he rip off more heads?\" asked Hermione, sounding squeamish. \"No,\" said Hagrid. \"I wish he had.\" \"What d'you mean?\" \"I mean we soon found out he didn' object ter all wizards — just us.\" \"Death Eaters?\" said Harry quickly. \"Yep,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"Couple of 'em were visitin' him ev'ry day, bringin' gifts ter the Gurg, an' he wasn' dangling them upside down.\" \"How d'you know they were Death Eaters?\" said Ron. \"Because I recognized one of 'em,\" Hagrid growled. \"Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes killin' as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin' on so well.\" \"So Macnair's persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?\" said Hermione desperately. \"Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven' finished me story yet!\" said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. \"Me  an' Olympe talked it over an' we agreed, jus' 'cause the Gurg looked like favorin' You-Know-Who didn' mean all of 'em would. We had ter try an' persuade some o' the others, the ones who hadn' wanted Golgomath as Gurg.\" \"How could you tell which ones they were?\" asked Ron. \"Well, they were the ones bein' beaten to a pulp, weren' they?\" said Hagrid patiently. \"The ones with any sense were keepin' outta Golgomath's way, hidin' out in caves roun' the gully jus' like we were. So we decided we'd go pokin' round the caves by night an' see if we couldn' persuade a few o' them.\" \"You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?\" said Ron with awed respect in his voice. \"Well, it wasn' the giants who worried us most,\" said Hagrid. \"We were more concerned abou' the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us before we wen' not ter tangle with 'em if we could avoid it, an' the trouble was they knew we was around — 'spect Golgomath told him abou' us. At night when the giants were sleepin' an' we wanted ter be creepin' inter the caves, Macnair an' the other one were sneakin' round the mountains lookin' fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin' out at them,\" said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard. \"She was rarin' ter attack 'em. . . . she's somethin' when she's roused, Olympe. . . . Fiery, yeh know . . . 'spect it's the French in her . . .\" Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty seconds' reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly. \"So what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?\" \"What? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin' in and headed back down inter the gully, keepin' our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o' the caves, no go — then, in abou' the sixth one, we found three giants hidin'.\" \"Cave must've been cramped,\" said Ron.'S TALE \"Wasn' room ter swing a kneazle,\" said Hagrid. \"Didn't they attack you when they saw you?\" asked Hermione. \"Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,\" said Ha-grid, \"but they was badly hurt, all three o' them. Golgomath's lot had beaten 'em unconscious; they'd woken up an' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o' them had a bit of English an' 'e translated fer the others, an' what we had ter say didn' seem ter go down too badly. So we kep' goin' back, visitin' the wounded. . . . I reckon we had abou' six or seven o' them convinced at one poin'.\" \"Six or seven?\" said Ron eagerly. \"Well that's not bad — are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?\" But Hermione said, \"What do you mean 'at one point,' Hagrid?\" Hagrid looked at her sadly. \"Golgomath's lot raided the caves. The ones tha' survived didn' wan' no more ter to do with us after that.\" \"So . . . so there aren't any giants coming?\" said Ron, looking disappointed. \"Nope,\" said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak again and applied the cooler side to his face, \"but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave 'em Dumbledore's message an' some o' them heard it an' I 'spect some o' them'll remember it. Jus' maybe, them that don' want ter stay around Golgomath'll move outta the mountains, an' there's gotta be a chance they'll remember Dumbledore's friendly to 'em. . . . Could be they'll come . . .\" Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap. \"Hagrid?\" said Hermione quietly after a while. \"Mmm?\" \"Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything about your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?\" Hagrid's unobscured eye rested upon her, and Hermione looked rather scared. \"I'm sorry . . . I . . . forget it —\" \"Dead,\" Hagrid grunted. \"Died years ago. They told me.\" \"Oh . . . I'm . . . I'm really sorry,\" said Hermione in a very small voice. Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. \"No need,\" he said shortly. \"Can' remember her much. Wasn' a great mother.\" They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak. \"But you still haven't explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,\" Ron said, gesturing toward Hagrid's bloodstained face. \"Or why you're back so late,\" said Harry. \"Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago —\" \"Who attacked you?\" said Ron. \"I haven' bin attacked!\" said Hagrid emphatically. \"I —\" But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain. \"It's her!\" Ron whispered. \"Get under here!\" Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived beneath the cloak as well. Huddled together they backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Ha-grid looked thoroughly confused. \"Hagrid, hide our mugs!\" Hagrid seized Harry's and Ron's mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang's basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open. Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her'S TALE green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to see Hagrid's face; she barely reached his navel. \"So,\" she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. \"You're Hagrid, are you?\" Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her bulging eyes rolling in every direction. \"Get away,\" she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face. \"Er — I don' want ter be rude,\" said Hagrid, staring at her, \"but who the ruddy hell are you?\" \"My name is Dolores Umbridge.\" Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione. \"Dolores Umbridge?\" Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. \"I thought you were one o' them Ministry — don' you work with Fudge?\" \"I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,\" said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak. \"I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher —\" \"Tha's brave of yeh,\" said Hagrid, \"there's not many'd take tha' job anymore —\" \"— and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,\" said Umbridge, giving no sign that she had heard him. \"Wha's that?\" said Hagrid, frowning. \"Precisely what I was going to ask,\" said Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione's mug. \"Oh,\" said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood hidden, \"oh, tha' was . . . was Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.\" Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabin's. \"I heard voices,\" she said quietly. \"I was talkin' ter Fang,\" said Hagrid stoutly. \"And was he talking back to you?\" \"Well . . . in a manner o' speakin',\" said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable. \"I sometimes say Fang's near enough human —\" \"There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,\" said Umbridge sleekly. Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth. Luckily, Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge's robes, and she did not appear to have heard. \"Well, I on'y jus' got back,\" said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack. \"Maybe someone came ter call earlier an' I missed em. \"There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.\" \"Well I . . . I don' know why that'd be. . . .\" said Hagrid, tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood, as though asking for help. \"Erm . . .\" Umbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin, looking around carefully. She bent and peered under the bed. She opened Hagrid's cupboards. She passed within two inches of where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled around again and said, \"What has happened to you? How did you sustain those injuries?\" Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in Harry's opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising 'S TALE all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. \"Oh, I . . . had a bit of an accident,\" he said lamely. \"What sort of accident?\" \"I-I tripped.\" \"You tripped,\" she repeated coolly. \"Yeah, tha's right. Over . . . over a friends broomstick. I don' fly, meself. Well, look at the size o' me, I don' reckon there's a broomstick that'd hold me. Friend o' mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if you've ever seen 'em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, I've had a bit of a ride on one o' them an' it was —\" \"Where have you been?\" asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through Hagrid's babbling. \"Where've I . . . ?\" \"Been, yes,\" she said. \"Term started more than two months ago. Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You left no address. Where have you been?\" There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye. Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously. \"I — I've been away for me health,\" he said. \"For your health,\" said Umbridge. Her eyes traveled over Hagrid's discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto his waistcoat in the silence. \"I see.\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"bit o' — o' fresh air, yeh know —\" \"Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,\" said Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid's face that was not black or purple flushed. \"Well — change o' scene, yeh know —\" \"Mountain scenery?\" said Umbridge swiftly. She knows, Harry thought desperately. \"Mountains?\" Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. \"Nope, South of France fer me. Bit o' sun an' . . . an' sea.\" \"Really?\" said Umbridge. \"You don't have much of a tan.\" \"Yeah . . . well . . . sensitive skin,\" said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out. Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered. Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, \"I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.\" \"Righ',\" said Hagrid, nodding. \"You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough.\" She turned sharply and marched back to the door. \"You're inspectin' us?\" Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after her. \"Oh yes,\" said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle. \"The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Good night.\" She left, closing the door behind her with a snap. Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist. \"Not yet,\" she breathed in his ear. \"She might not be gone yet.\" Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so. \"She's goin' back ter the castle,\" he said in a low voice. \"Blimey . . . inspectin' people, is she?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, pulling the cloak off. \"Trelawney's on probation already. . . .\" \"Um . . . what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione. \"Oh, don' you worry abou' that, I've got a great load o' lessons planned,\" said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again. \"I've bin keepin' a'S TALE couple o' creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they're some-thin' really special.\" \"Erm . . . special in what way?\" asked Hermione tentatively. \"I'm not sayin',\" said Hagrid happily. \"I don' want ter spoil the surprise.\" \"Look, Hagrid,\" said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense, \"Professor Umbridge won't be at all happy if you bring anything to class that's too dangerous —\" \"Dangerous?\" said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. \"Don' be silly, I wouldn' give yeh anythin' dangerous! I mean, all righ', they can look after themselves —\" \"Hagrid, you've got to pass Umbridge's inspection, and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like that!\" said Hermione earnestly. \"But tha's not very interestin', Hermione,\" said Hagrid. \"The stuff I've got's much more impressive, I've bin bringin' 'em on fer years, I reckon I've got the on'y domestic herd in Britain —\" \"Hagrid . . . please . . .\" said Hermione, a note of real desperation in her voice. \"Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull that's bound to come up in our O.W.L. . . .\" But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing toward the vast bed in the corner. \"Lis'en, it's bin a long day an' it's late,\" he said, patting Hermione gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud. \"Oh — sorry —\" He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes. \"Look, don' you go worryin' abou' me, I promise yeh I've got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I'm back. . . . Now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an' don' forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!\" \"I dunno if you got through to him,\" said Ron a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went. \"Then I'll go back again tomorrow,\" said Hermione determinedly. \"I'll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don't care if she throws out Trelawney but she's not taking Hagrid!\"\n",

      "Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat's, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh. Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them. \"My Lord . . .\" he choked, \"my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise . . .\" \"Hold out your arm,\" said Voldemort lazily. \"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master . . .\" He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again. \"The other arm, Wormtail.\" \"Master, please . . . please . . .\" Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo — a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth — the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping. \"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it . . . and now, we shall see . . . now we shall know . . .\" He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. The scar on Harry's forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard. \"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\" he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \"And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face. \"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\" he hissed softly. \"A Muggle and a fool . . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. . . .\" Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass. \"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. . . . He didn't like magic, my father . . . \"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born, Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him . . . I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\" Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. \"Listen to me, reliving family history . . .\" he said quietly, \"why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\" The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes. Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort, and kissed the hem of his black robes. \"Master . . . Master . . .\" he murmured. The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle's grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind, a rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered. \"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years . . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday. . . . We are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\" He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like nostrils widening. \"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench of guilt upon the air.\" A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare, to step back from him. \"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact — such prompt appearances! — and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\" No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. \"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must haveCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . . \"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living? \"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort . . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\" At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them. \"It is a disappointment to me . . . I confess myself disappointed. . . .\" One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet. \"Master!\" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\" Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . . . anything . . . Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. \"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years . . . I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\" He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob. \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please, Master . . . please . . .\" \"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers. . . .\" Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtail's bleeding wrist. Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. \"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master . . . it is beautiful . . . thank you . . . thank you. . . .\" He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort. \"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\" Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay . . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\" \"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me —\" \"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. . . . I expect more faithful service in the future.\" \"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. . . .\" Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space — large enough for two people — that separated Malfoy and the next man. \"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us . . . they are our natural allies . . . we will recall the banished giants . . . I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. . . .\" He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. \"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. . . .\" \"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair. \"And here\" — Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures — \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\" They bowed clumsily, muttering dully. \"Yes, Master . . .\" \"We will, Master. . . .\" \"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyle's shadow. \"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful —\" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort. He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there. \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return . . . he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever . . . he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. \"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . . \"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\" There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Worm-tail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. \"Master, we crave to know . . . we beg you to tell us . . . how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. . . .\" \"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins — and ends — with my young friend here.\" He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle. \"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him — and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. . . . I could not touch the boy.\" Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek. \"His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it . . . but no matter. I can touch him now.\" Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know . . . I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal — to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked . . . for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself . . . for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . . \"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. . . . I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me . . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . . but I waited in vain. . . .\" The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE I sometimes inhabited animals — snakes, of course, being my preference — but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . . \"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard — young, foolish, and gullible — wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of . . . for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school . . . he was easy to bend to my will . . . he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. . . .\" Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry. \"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\" Voldemort continued. \"I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour . . . I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. . . .\" One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice. \"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last . . . a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . . \"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic. \"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail — displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him — convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her . . . he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams . . . for — with a little persuasion — she became a veritable mine of information. \"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things . . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless. \"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth . . . a spell or two of my own invention . . . a little help from my dear Nagini,\" Voldemort's red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \"a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided . . . I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel. \"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower . . . I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength. \"I knew that to achieve this — it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight — I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . . \"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe . . . Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me . . . as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potter's blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . . . \"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. . . . I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggle-loving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him? \"Why . . . by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament — that he touched the Triwizard Cup first — the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is . . . the boy you all believed had been my downfall. . . .\" Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar;CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end . . . to black out . . . to die . . . And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter. \"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\" said Voldemort. \"But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\" he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching. \"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\"\n",

      "It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking. \"You're both mental.\" \"Ridiculous!\" said Hermione faintly. \"Peter Pettigrew's dead!\" said Harry. \"He killed him twelve years ago!\" He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively. \"I meant to,\" he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \"but little Peter got the better of me . . . not this time, though!\" And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg. \"Sirius, NO!\" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \"WAIT! You can't do it just like that — they need to understand — we've got to explain —\" \"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he tried to escape. \"They've — got — a — right — to — know — everything!\" Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \"Ron's kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don't understand! And Harry — you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!\" Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, and bleeding hands. \"All right, then,\" Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat. \"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for. . . .\" \"You're nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. \"I've had enough of this. I'm off.\" He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers. \"You're going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\" \"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him and pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin. \"There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" he said. \"A whole street full of them . . .\"MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS \"They didn't see what they thought they saw!\" said Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands. \"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,\" said Lupin, nodding. \"I believed it myself — until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map never lies . . . Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry.\" Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all — but why was Lupin playing along with him? Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly. \"But Professor Lupin . . . Scabbers can't be Pettigrew . . . it just can't be true, you know it can't . . .\" \"Why can't it be true?\" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows. \"Because . . . because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things . . . and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the list —\" Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.  \"Right again, Hermione!\" he said. \"But the Ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\" \"If you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. \"I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.\" \"All right . . . but you'll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, \"I only know how it began . . .\" Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing. \"No one there . . .\" \"This place is haunted!\" said Ron. \"It's not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The Shrieking Shack was never haunted. . . . The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\" He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment, then said, \"That's where all of this starts — with my becoming a werewolf. None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitten . . . and if I hadn't been so foolhardy. . . .\" He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione said, \"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently. \"I was a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform. . . . I am able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again. \"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children exposed to me. \"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn't come to school. . . .\" Lupin sighed, and looked directly at Harry. \"I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts. This house\" — Lupin looked miserably around the room, — \"the tunnel that leads to it — they were built for my use. Once a month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous.\" Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he was listening raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin's voice was Scabbers's frightened squeaking. \"My transformations in those days were — were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor. . . . Even now, when the house has been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it. . . . \"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black . . . Peter Pettigrew . . . and, of course, your father, Harry — James Potter. \"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her. . . . I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth. . . . \"And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.\" \"My dad too?\" said Harry, astounded. \"Yes, indeed,\" said Lupin. \"It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.\" \"But how did that help you?\" said Hermione, sounding puzzled. \"They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,\" said Lupin. \"A werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak. They transformed . . . Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then slip down the tunnel and joinMOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS me. Under their influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them.\" \"Hurry up, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face. \"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there . . . well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. . . . And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.\" \"What sort of animal — ?\" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off. \"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?\" \"A thought that still haunts me,\" said Lupin heavily. \"And there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness.\" \"I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course . . . he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month's adventure. And I haven't changed . . . Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. \"All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others along with me . . . and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it . . . so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along.\" \"Snape?\" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \"What's Snape got to do with it?\" \"He's here, Sirius,\" said Lupin heavily. \"He's teaching here as well.\" He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons . . . you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me —\" Black made a derisive noise. \"It served him right,\" he sneered. \"Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to . . . hoping he could get us expelled. . . .\"MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS \"Severus was very interested in where I went every month.\" Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"We were in the same year, you know, and we — er — didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field . . . anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be — er — amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it — if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf — but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life . . . Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was. . . .\" \"So that's why Snape doesn't like you,\" said Harry slowly, \"because he thought you were in on the joke?\" \"That's right,\" sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin. Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing directly at Lupin.\n",
