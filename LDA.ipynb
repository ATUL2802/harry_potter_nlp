      "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\" Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing . . .\" Dudley's birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he  wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\" Don't ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put  together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\" Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty . . . thirty . . .\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction. Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. \"What about what's-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \". . . and leave him in the car. . . .\" \"That cars new, he's not sitting in it alone. . . .\" Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying — it had been years since he'd really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I . . . don't . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly . . .\" But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \". . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don't,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" The snake nodded vigorously. \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see — so you've never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He  couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n"

      "The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. \"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\" he told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\" \"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn't as bad as usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years. That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. \"What's this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. \"Your new school uniform,\" she said. Harry looked in the bowl again. \"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn't realize it had to be so wet.\" \"Don't be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished.\" Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. \"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. \"Make Harry get it.\" \"Get the mail, Harry.\" \"Make Dudley get it.\" \"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\" Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. \"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. \"Marge's ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk . . .\" \"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry's got something!\" Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. \"That's mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \"Who'd be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. \"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped. Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \"Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!\" They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. \"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. \"I want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it's mine.\" \"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. Harry didn't move. \"I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted. \"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley. \"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. \"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?\" \"Watching — spying — might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't want —\" Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. \"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer. . . . Yes, that's best . . . we won't do anything. . . .\" \"But —\" \"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\" That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. \"Where's my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who's writing to me?\"THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE \"No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly. \"I have burned it.\" \"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\" \"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. \"Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking . . . you're really getting a bit big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.\" \"Why?\" said Harry. \"Don't ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs, now.\" The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched. From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \"I don't want him in there . . . I need that room . . . make him get out. . . .\" Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There's another one! &lsquo;Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —' \" With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE \"Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley — go — just go.\" Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan. The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door — \"AAAAARRRGH!\" Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. \"I want —\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didn't go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. \"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can't deliver them they'll just give up.\" \"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon.\" \"Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" as he worked, and jumped at small noises. On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. \"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in amazement.THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today —\" Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one — \"Out! OUT!\" Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. \"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \"I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\" He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake 'em off . . . shake 'em off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this. They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering. . . . They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. \" 'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk.\" She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. \"I'll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE \"Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. \"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. \"It's Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto's on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\" Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every day. Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought. \"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\" It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. \"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \"And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\" A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \"I've already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\" It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully. He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all. As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow. Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . twenty . . . ten . . . nine — maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . . BOOM. The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\n",

      "Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. \"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home.\" He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it. \"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches. \"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron.\" \"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoy's cold drawl from behind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to.\" Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \"WEASLEY!\" Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes. \"He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \"Malfoy was insultin' his family.\" \"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said Snape silkily. \"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you.\" Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \"I'll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, \"one of these days, I'll get him —\" \"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\" \"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,\" said Hagrid. \"Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\" So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. \"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?\" The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. \"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked. \"Just one,\" said Hermione. \"And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\" \"Oh yeah, you're right,\" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. \"The library?\" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \"Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?\" \"Oh, we're not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is.\" \"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here — I've told yeh — drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'.\" \"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,\" said Hermione. \"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I've read his name somewhere.\" \"I'm sayin' nothin',\" said Hagrid flatly. \"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \"What are you looking for, boy?\" \"Nothing,\" said Harry. Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. \"You'd better get out, then. Go on — out!\" Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to. Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. \"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?\" said Hermione. \"And send me an owl if you find anything.\" \"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron. \"It'd be safe to ask them.\" \"Very safe, as they're both dentists,\" said Hermione. Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work. Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. \"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. \"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I've got some presents!\" \"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's. Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl. A second, very small parcel contained a note. We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece. \"That's friendly,\" said Harry. Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \"Weird!\" he said, \"What a shape! This is money?\" \"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?\" \"I think I know who that one's from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn't expect any presents and — oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she's made you a Weasley sweater.\" Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. \"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and mine's always maroon.\" \"That's really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty. His next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. \"I've heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. \"If that's what I think it is — they're really rare, and really valuable.\" \"What is it?\" Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. \"It's an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I'm sure it is — try it on.\" Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell. \"It is! Look down!\" Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. \"There's a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\" Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. A Very Merry Christmas to you. There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak. \"I'd give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What's the matter?\" \"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. \"Merry Christmas!\" \"Hey, look — Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\" Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. \"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.\" \"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.\" \"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. \"You haven't got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid — we know we're called Gred and Forge.\" \"What's all this noise?\" Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. \"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\" \"I — don't — want —\" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. \"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George. \"Christmas is a time for family.\" They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater. Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner. Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much. After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge. It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it. Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. His father's . . . this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said. He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. Use it well. Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back — his father's cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use it alone. He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. \"Who's there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked. The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be. He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears. He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library — Restricted Section.\" Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.\" Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him — the cloak didn't stop him from being solid. He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air — she and the others existed only in the mirror. She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did. Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. \"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\" They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, \"I'll come back,\" and hurried from the room. \"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly. \"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.\" \"I'd like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly. \"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\" \"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?\" Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the threeheaded dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\" What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. \"I'm freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let's forget it and go back.\" \"No!\" Harry hissed. \"I know it's here somewhere.\" They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. \"It's here — just here — yes!\" They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. \"See?\" Harry whispered. \"I can't see anything.\" \"Look! Look at them all . . . there are loads of them. . . .\" \"I can only see you.\" \"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\" Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \"Look at me!\" he said. \"Can you see all your family standing around you?\" \"No — I'm alone — but I'm different — I look older — and I'm Head Boy!\" \"What?\" \"I am — I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I'm holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I'm Quidditch captain, too!\" Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. \"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\" \"How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —\" \"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\" \"You're only holding the Quidditch Cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\" \"Don't push me —\" A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking. \"Quick!\" Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left. \"This isn't safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\" And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. The snow still hadn't melted the next morning. \"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron. \"No.\" \"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?\" \"No . . . you go . . .\" \"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight.\" \"Why not?\" \"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\" \"You sound like Hermione.\" \"I'm serious, Harry, don't go.\" But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him. That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone. And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. Except — \"So — back again, Harry?\" Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him. \"I — I didn't see you, sir.\" \"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. \"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\" \"I didn't know it was called that, sir.\" \"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?\" \"It — well — it shows me my family —\" \"And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.\" \"How did you know — ?\" \"I don't need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\" Harry shook his head. \"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\" Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want . . . whatever we want . . .\" \"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. \"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry,  and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\" Harry stood up. \"Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\" \"Obviously, you've just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one more thing, however.\" \"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" Harry stared. \"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\" It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\n",

      "Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts. Ginny gave a gasp of horror. \"To me, Potter,\" repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up. Harry's insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped and outnumbered two to one. \"To me,\" said Malfoy yet again. \"Where's Sirius?\" Harry said. Several of the Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry's left said triumphantly, \"The Dark Lord always knows!\" \"Always,\" echoed Malfoy softly. \"Now, give me the prophecy, Potter.\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" mimicked the woman to his left. She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were &bull; 781 &bull; CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry's eyes. \"You've got him,\" said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row. \"He's here. I know he is.\" \"The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo,\" said the woman in a horrible, mock-baby voice. Harry felt Ron stir beside him. \"Don't do anything,\" he muttered. \"Not yet —\" The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter. \"You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!\" \"Oh, you don't know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,\" said Malfoy softly. \"He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.\" \"I know Sirius is here,\" said Harry, though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly. \"I know you've got him!\" More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman still laughed loudest of all. \"It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.\" \"Go on, then,\" said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry's stomach tightened. If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all. . . . But the Death Eaters did not strike. \"Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,\" said Malfoy coolly. It was Harry's turn to laugh. \"Yeah, right!\" he said. \"I give you this — prophecy, is it? And you'll just let us skip off home, will you?\" The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked, \"Accio Proph —\" Harry was just ready for her. He shouted \"Protego!\" before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it. \"Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,\" she said, her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. \"Very well, then —\" \"I TOLD YOU, NO!\" Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. \"If you smash it — !\" Harry's mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get them all out of this alive, make sure that none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity . . . The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow. \"You need more persuasion?\" she said, her chest rising and falling rapidly. \"Very well — take the smallest one,\" she ordered the Death Eaters beside her. \"Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I'll do it.\" Harry felt the others close in around Ginny. He stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest. \"You'll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,\" he told Bellatrix. \"I don't think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he?\" She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth. \"So,\" said Harry, \"what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway?\"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville's arm was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking. He could feel one of the other's quickened breath on the back of his head. He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his mind was blank. \"What kind of prophecy?\" repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from her face. \"You jest, Harry Potter.\" \"Nope, not jesting,\" said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape. \"How come Voldemort wants it?\" Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses. \"You dare speak his name?\" whispered Bellatrix. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. \"Yeah, I've got no problem saying Vol —\" \"Shut your mouth!\" Bellatrix shrieked. \"You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood's tongue, you dare —\" \"Did you know he's a half-blood too?\" said Harry recklessly. Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. \"Voldemort? Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle — or has he been telling you lot he's pureblood?\" \"STUPEF —\" \"NO!\" A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange's wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. His spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered. Two figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak. Their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments  of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix's shouts. \". . . at the Solstice will come a new . . .\" said the figure of an old, bearded man. \"DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!\" \"He dared — he dares —\" shrieked Bellatrix incoherently. \"— He stands there — filthy half-blood —\" \"WAIT UNTIL WE'VE GOT THE PROPHECY!\" bawled Malfoy. \". . . and none will come after . . .\" said the figure of a young woman. The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however, given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the others. \"You haven't told me what's so special about this prophecy I'm supposed to be handing over,\" he said, playing for time. He moved his foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else's. \"Do not play games with us, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"I'm not playing games,\" said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone's toes and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermione's. \"What?\" she whispered. \"Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?\" said Malfoy sneeringly. \"I — what?\" said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan. \"What about my scar?\" \"What?\" whispered Hermione more urgently behind him. \"Can this be?\" said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of theirCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, \"Smash shelves —\" \"Dumbledore never told you?\" Malfoy repeated. \"Well, this explains why you didn't come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why —\" \"— when I say go —\" \"— you didn't come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording. . . .\" \"Did he?\" said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. \"So he wanted me to come and get it, did he? Why?\" \"Why?\" Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. \"Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him.\" \"And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?\" \"About both of you, Potter, about both of you . . . Haven't you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?\" Harry stared into the slitted eyeholes through which Malfoy's gray eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry's parents had died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand? \"Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?\" he said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust. \"And he's made me come and get it for him? Why couldn't he come and get it himself?\" \"Get it himself?\" shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter. \"The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?\" \"So he's got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?\" said Harry. \"Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?\" \"Very good, Potter, very good . . .\" said Malfoy slowly. \"But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell —\" \"NOW!\" yelled Harry. Five different voices behind him bellowed \"REDUCTO!\" Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor — \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of Hermione's robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres — Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout \"Stupefy!\" and the hand released him at once. They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione's voice urging Neville on. The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them — \"Colloportus!\" gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise. \"Where — where are the others?\" gasped Harry. He had thought that Ron, Luna, and Ginny had been ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there. \"They must have gone the wrong way!\" whispered Hermione, terror in her face. \"Listen!\" whispered Neville. Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed. Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar: \"Leave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care for Nott's injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson, come back here, we need to organize! We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary — Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right — Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight ahead — Macnair and Avery, through here — Rookwood, over there — Mulciber, come with me!\" \"What do we do?\" Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot. \"Well, we don't stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,\" said Harry. \"Let's get away from this door. . . .\" They ran, quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, toward the exit into the  circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut. \"Stand aside!\" said a rough voice. \"Alohomora!\" As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione, and Neville dived under desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters' robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly. \"They might've run straight through to the hall,\" said the rough voice. \"Check under the desks,\" said another. Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend. Poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted, \"STUPEFY !\" A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry's spell and now pointed his own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim. \"Avada —\" Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, \"EXPELLIARMUS !\" Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front and Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck at what he had done. \"Get out of the way, Harry!\" yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage. Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted, \"STUPEFY !\"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater's shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses. The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered — The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned — his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, \"STUP —\" \"STUPEFY !\" screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest; he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind. \"Accio Wand !\" cried Hermione. Harry's wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him. \"Thanks,\" he said, \"right, let's get out of —\" \"Look out!\" said Neville, horrified, staring at the Death Eater's head in the bell jar. All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck. They were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man's head. It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull, his cheeks smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz. . . . A baby's head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again. But even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again, thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin. . . . \"It's time,\" said Hermione in an awestruck voice. \"Time . . .\" The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together again, it began to shrink back to babyhood once more. . . . There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream. \"RON?\" Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. \"GINNY? LUNA?\" \"Harry!\" Hermione screamed. The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby's head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing Harry, who ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm. \"You can't hurt a baby!\" There was no time to argue the point. Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position. \"Come on!\" he said again, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them, they took off for the door that stood ajar at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway. They had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room toward them. Veering left he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the door behind them. \"Collo —\" began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled, \"IMPEDIMENTA!\" Harry, Hermione, and Neville were all knocked backward off their feet. Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry's head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes, and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react. \"WE'VE GOT HIM!\" yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry, \"IN AN OFFICE OFF —\" \"Silencio!\" cried Hermione, and the man's voice was extinguished. He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward, facedown onto the rug at Harry's feet, stiff as a board and unable to move at all. \"Well done, Ha —\" But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of what looked like purple flame. It passed right across Hermione's chest; she gave a tiny \"oh!\" as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where she lay motionless. \"HERMIONE!\" Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly toward her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville's head as he emerged — his foot broke Neville's wand in two and connected with his face — Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts. Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harry's hand, to himself, then at Hermione. Though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been clearer: Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her. . . . \"Like you won't kill us all the moment I hand it over anyway!\" said Harry. A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly. He had one hand on Hermione's shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don't let her be dead, don't let her be dead, it's my fault if she's dead. . . . \"Whaddever you do, Harry,\" said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, \"don'd gib it to him!\" Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him. Harry seized his chance: \"PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!\" The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it, and he toppled forward across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch. \"Hermione,\" Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again. \"Hermione, wake up. . . .\" \"Whaddid he do to her?\" said Neville, crawling out from under the desk again to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose. \"I dunno. . . .\" Neville groped for Hermione's wrist. \"Dat's a pulse, Harry, I'b sure id is. . . .\" Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed. \"She's alive?\" \"Yeah, I dink so. . . .\" There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sounds of CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby Death Eater in the next room. \"Neville, we're not far from the exit,\" Harry whispered. \"We're right next to that circular room. . . . If we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I'll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift. . . . Then you could find someone. . . . Raise the alarm . . .\" \"And whad are you going do do?\" said Neville, mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry. \"I've got to find the others,\" said Harry. \"Well, I'b going do find dem wid you,\" said Neville firmly. \"But Hermione —\" \"We'll dake her wid us,\" said Neville firmly. \"I'll carry her — you're bedder at fighding dem dan I ab —\" He stood up and seized one of Hermione's arms, glared at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione's limp form over Neville's shoulders. \"Wait,\" said Harry, snatching up Hermione's wand from the floor and shoving it into Nevilles hand, \"you'd better take this. . . .\" Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly toward the door. \"My gran's going do kill be,\" said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, \"dat was by dad's old wand. . . .\" Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter, and repair itself on the wall behind them. \"He's never going to notice us,\" he whispered. \"C'mon . . . keep close behind me. . . .\" They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forward, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione's weight. The door of the Time Room swung shut behind them, and the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of Harry's head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart Harry saw that Hermione's fiery crosses had faded from the doors. \"So which way d'you reck — ?\" But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it. \"Ron!\" croaked Harry, dashing toward them. \"Ginny — are you all — ?\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the front of Harry's robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes. \"There you are. . . . Ha ha ha . . . You look funny, Harry. . . . You're all messed up. . . . Ron's face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry's robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow. \"Ginny?\" Harry said fearfully. \"What happened?\" But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle. \"I think her ankle's broken, I heard something crack,\" whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt. \"Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark —\" \"Harry, we saw Uranus up close!\" said Ron, still giggling feebly. \"Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus — ha ha ha —\"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron's mouth and burst. \"Anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny's foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but . . .\" Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed. \"And what about Ron?\" said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry's robes. \"I don't know what they hit him with,\" said Luna sadly, \"but he's gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all. . . .\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, pulling Harry's ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, \"you know who this girl is, Harry? She's Loony . . . Loony Lovegood . . . ha ha ha . . .\" \"We've got to get out of here,\" said Harry firmly. \"Luna, can you help Ginny?\" \"Yes,\" said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, putting an arm around Ginny's waist and pulling her up. \"It's only my ankle, I can do it myself!\" said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Ron's arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dudley's. He looked around: They had a one-in-twelve chance of getting the exit right the first time — He heaved Ron toward a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped into the hall, led by Bellatrix Lestrange. \"There they are!\" she shrieked. Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him, and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione. They were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix. \"Colloportus!\" shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side. \"It doesn't matter!\" said a man's voice. \"There are other ways in — WE'VE GOT THEM, THEY'RE HERE!\" Harry spun around. They were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first. \"Luna — Neville — help me!\" The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door. \"Colloportus!\" There were footsteps running along behind the doors; every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered. Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall — then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry, \"Collo — aaaaaaaaargh . . .\" He turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione. \"Get Potter!\" shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him. He dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy — \"Hey!\" said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward Harry, giggling. \"Hey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn't that weird, Harry?\" \"Ron, get out of the way, get down —\" But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank. \"Honest, Harry, they're brains — look — Accio Brain!\" The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny, and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish. For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared toward Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film — \"Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it —\" said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards. \"Harry, come and touch it, bet it's weird —\" \"RON, NO!\" Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands. The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron's arms like ropes. \"Harry, look what's happen — no — no, I don't like it — no, stop — stop —\" But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron's chest now. He tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus's body. \"Diffindo!\" yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds. \"Harry, it'll suffocate him!\" screamed Ginny, immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor — then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater's wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious. \"STUBEFY !\" shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermione's wand at the oncoming Death Eaters. \"STUBEFY, STUBEFY !\" But nothing happened — one of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that left craters in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange sprinted right at him. Holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others. It seemed to have worked. They streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come. Inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron — find some way of releasing him — he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish — He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters' laughter. He looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending toward him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench toward him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him. The prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sights. The back of his legs hit something solid; he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed backward onto it. The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the full Body-Bind, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry's face. \"Potter, your race is run,\" drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his mask. \"Now hand me the prophecy like a good boy. . . .\" \"Let — let the others go, and I'll give it to you!\" said Harry desperately.CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE A few of the Death Eaters laughed. \"You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,\" said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure. \"You see, there are ten of us and only one of you . . . or hasn't Dumbledore ever taught you how to count?\" \"He's dot alone!\" shouted a voice from above them. \"He's still god be!\" Harry's heart sank. Neville was scrambling down the stone benches toward them, Hermione's wand held fast in his trembling hand. \"Neville — no — go back to Ron —\" \"STUBEFY !\" Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn, \"STUBEFY ! STUBE —\" One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed. \"It's Longbottom, isn't it?\" sneered Lucius Malfoy. \"Well, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause. . . . Your death will not come as a great shock. . . .\" \"Longbottom?\" repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face. \"Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy. . . .\" \"I DOE YOU HAB!\" roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captor's encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, \"Someone Stun him!\" \"No, no, no,\" said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. \"No, let's see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents. . . . Unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy —\" \"DON'D GIB ID DO DEM!\" roared Neville, who seemed beside himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor, her wand raised. \"DON'D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!\" Bellatrix raised her wand. \"Crucio!\" Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony. \"That was just a taster!\" said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that Neville's screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned and gazed up at Harry. \"Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!\" Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy was hot with the heat from his clutching hand as he held it out. Malfoy jumped forward to take it. Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley. Malfoy turned and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville. \"Are you okay?\" he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads. \"Yes,\" said Neville, trying to pull himself up. \"And Ron?\" \"I dink he's all right — he was still fighding the brain when I left —\" The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville's hand had been seconds before. Both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor. \"Give it to me,\" growled a voice in his ear, \"give me the prophecy —\" The man was pressing so tightly on Harry's windpipe that he could not breathe — through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away. Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix — nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. . . . He turned his wand backward toward the man's side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man's free hand was groping toward the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy — \"AARGH!\" Neville had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione's wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater's mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped, \"STUPEFY !\" The Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off. It was Macnair, Buckbeak's would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot. \"Thanks!\" Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs. Then Harry's foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped — for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, then saw Moody's magic eye spinning away across the floor. Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee. \"Tarantallegra!\" he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again. \"Now, Potter —\" He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, \"Protego!\" Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville's jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell. Dolohov raised his wand again. \"Accio Proph —\" Sirius hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder, and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry's fingers but he had managed to cling to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand tips — Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Once again, Dolohov's arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backward, landing with a crash on his back. \"Nice one!\" shouted Sirius, forcing Harry's head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew toward them. \"Now I want you to get out of —\" They both ducked again. A jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius; across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat, and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back toward the fray. \"Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville, and run!\" Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew over Harry's head as he launched himself toward Neville — \"Can you stand?\" he bellowed in Neville's ear, as Neville's legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably. \"Put your arm round my neck —\" Neville did so — Harry heaved — Neville's legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them. Both fell backward, Neville's legsCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE waving wildly like an overturned beetle's, Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed. \"The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!\" snarled Lucius Malfoy's voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy's wand pressing hard between his ribs. \"No — get — off — me . . . Neville — catch it!\" Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, \"Impedimenta!\" Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them. \"Harry, round up the others and GO!\" Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone steps. Neville's legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight. Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step — A spell hit the stone bench at Harry's heel. It crumbled away and he fell back to the step below: Neville sank to the ground, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and thrust the prophecy into his pocket. \"Come on!\" said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville's robes. \"Just try and push with your legs —\" He gave another stupendous heave and Neville's robes tore all along the left seam — the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and before either of them could catch it, one of Neville's floundering feet kicked it. It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with  hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness. \"Harry, I'b sorry!\" cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder, \"I'b so sorry, Harry, I didn'd bean do —\" \"It doesn't matter!\" Harry shouted. \"Just try and stand, let's get out of —\" \"Dubbledore!\" said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry's shoulder. \"What?\" \"DUBBLEDORE!\" Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body — they were saved. Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thought of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there. There were yells; one of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore's spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line — Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of red light: He was laughing at her. \"Come on, you can do better than that!\" he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room. The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest. The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock.CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore turned to the dais too. It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall. His body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch. . . . And Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather's wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place. Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange's triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing — Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he would reappear from the other side any second. . . . But Sirius did not reappear. \"SIRIUS!\" Harry yelled, \"SIRIUS!\" He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out again. . . . But as he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back. \"There's nothing you can do, Harry —\" \"Get him, save him, he's only just gone through!\" \"It's too late, Harry —\" \"We can still reach him —\" Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go. . . . \"There's nothing you can do, Harry . . . nothing. . . . He's gone.\"\n",

      "Harry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman inside his chest over the following two weeks, a glowing secret that supported him through Umbridge's classes and even made it possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible bulging eyes. He and the D.A. were resisting her under her very nose, doing the very thing that she and the Ministry most feared, and whenever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard's book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings, remembering how Neville had successfully disarmed Hermione, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after three meetings' hard effort, how Parvati Patil had produced such a good Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to dust. He was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for D.A. meetings, as they had to accommodate three separate Quidditch teams' practices, which were often rearranged depending on the weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry about this, he had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable. If anyone was watching them, it would be hard to make out a pattern. Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice, because it would look so suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often. She gave each of the members of the D.A. a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when he saw the basket at first, convinced that she was actually giving out gold). \"You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?\" Hermione said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting. The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches. \"On real Galleons that's just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. The coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if you're carrying them in a pocket you'll be able to feel them. We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he'll change the numbers on his coin, and because I've put a Protean Charm on them, they'll all change to mimic his.\" A blank silence greeted Hermione's words. She looked around at all the faces upturned to her, rather disconcerted. \"Well — I thought it was a good idea,\" she said uncertainly, \"I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there's nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But . . . well, if you don't want to use them . . .\" \"You can do a Protean Charm?\" said Terry Boot. \"Yes,\" said Hermione. \"But that's . . . that's N.E.W.T. standard, that is,\" he said weakly. \"Oh,\" said Hermione, trying to look modest. \"Oh . . . well . . . yes, I suppose it is. . . .\"THE LION AND THE SERPENT \"How come you're not in Ravenclaw?\" he demanded, staring at Hermione with something close to wonder. \"With brains like yours?\" \"Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Raven-claw during my Sorting,\" said Hermione brightly, \"but it decided on Gryffindor in the end. So does that mean we're using the Galleons?\" There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forward to collect one from the basket. Harry looked sideways at Hermione. \"You know what these remind me of?\" \"No, what's that?\" \"The Death Eaters' scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all their scars burn, and they know they've got to join him.\" \"Well . . . yes,\" said Hermione quietly. \"That is where I got the idea . . . but you'll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members' skin. . . .\" \"Yeah . . . I prefer your way,\" said Harry, grinning, as he slipped his Galleon into his pocket. \"I suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them.\" \"Fat chance,\" said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air. \"I haven't got any real Galleons to confuse it with.\" As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, drew nearer, their D.A. meetings were put on hold because Angelina insisted on almost daily practices. The fact that the Quid-ditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretense of sportsmanship, were determined to see their side's victory. Harry realized how much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match. \"I think you've got enough to be getting on with at the moment,\" she said loftily. Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, \"I've become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don't want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practice, won't you?\" Snape was no less obviously partisan: He had booked the Quid-ditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play. He was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library. Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor's chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoy's team. Admittedly Ron was still not performing to Wood's standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form: During one memorable practice, he had hung one-handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end. The rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made recently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland's top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said that Ron mightTHE LION AND THE SERPENT yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously considering admitting that he was related to them, something he assured Ron they had been trying to deny for four years. The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even got onto the pitch. Harry, of course, had endured their snide comments for more than four years, so whispers of, \"Hey, Potty, I heard Warrington's sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday,\" far from chilling his blood, made him laugh. \"Warrington's aim's so pathetic I'd be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,\" he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson's face. But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers, and intimidation. When Slytherins, some of them seventh years and considerably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, \"Got your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?\" he did not laugh, but turned a delicate shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they were within sight of each other), Ron's ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time too. October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every morning and icy drafts that bit at exposed hands and faces. The skies and the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly gray, the mountains around Hogwarts became snowcapped, and the temperature in the castle dropped so far that many students wore their thick protective dragon skin gloves in the corridors between lessons. The morning of the match dawned bright and cold. When Harry awoke he looked around at Ron's bed and saw him sitting bolt upright, his arms around his knees, staring fixedly into space. \"You all right?\" said Harry. Ron nodded but did not speak. Harry was reminded forcibly of the time that Ron had accidentally put a slug-vomiting charm on himself. He looked just as pale and sweaty as he had done then, not to mention as reluctant to open his mouth. \"You just need some breakfast,\" Harry said bracingly. \"C'mon.\" The Great Hall was filling up fast when they arrived, the talk louder and the mood more exuberant than usual. As they passed the Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise; Harry looked around and saw that nearly everyone there was wearing, in addition to the usual green-and-silver scarves and hats, silver badges in the shape of what seemed to be crowns. For some reason many of them waved at Ron, laughing uproariously. Harry tried to see what was written on the badges as he walked by, but he was too concerned to get Ron past their table quickly to linger long enough to read them. They received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table, where everyone was wearing red and gold, but far from raising Ron's spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale; he collapsed onto the nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal. \"I must've been mental to do this,\" he said in a croaky whisper. \"Mental.\" \"Don't be thick,\" said Harry firmly, passing him a choice of cereals. \"You're going to be fine. It's normal to be nervous.\" \"I'm rubbish,\" croaked Ron. \"I'm lousy. I can't play to save my life. What was I thinking?\" \"Get a grip,\" said Harry sternly. \"Look at that save you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant —\" Ron turned a tortured face to Harry. \"That was an accident,\" he whispered miserably. \"I didn't mean to do it — I slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and I was trying to get back on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident.\" \"Well,\" said Harry, recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise, \"a few more accidents like that and the game's in the bag, isn't it?\"THE LION AND THE SERPENT Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing red-andgold scarves, gloves, and rosettes. \"How're you feeling?\" Ginny asked Ron, who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them. \"He's just nervous,\" said Harry. \"Well, that's a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams if you're not a bit nervous,\" said Hermione heartily. \"Hello,\" said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them. Harry looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table. Many people were staring at her and a few openly laughing and pointing; she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lion's head, which was perched precariously on her head. \"I'm supporting Gryffindor,\" said Luna, pointing unnecessarily at her hat. \"Look what it does. . . .\" She reached up and tapped the hat with her wand. It opened its mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump. \"It's good, isn't it?\" said Luna happily. \"I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin, you know, but there wasn't time. Anyway . . . good luck, Ronald!\" She drifted away. They had not quite recovered from the shock of Luna's hat before Angelina came hurrying toward them, accompanied by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by Madam Pomfrey. \"When you're ready,\" she said, \"we're going to go straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and change.\" \"We'll be there in a bit,\" Harry assured her. \"Ron's just got to have some breakfast.\" It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capable of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him  down to the changing rooms. As they rose from the table, Hermione got up too, and taking Harry's arm, she drew him to one side. \"Don't let Ron see what's on those Slytherins' badges,\" she whispered urgently. Harry looked questioningly at her, but she shook her head warningly; Ron had just ambled over to them, looking lost and desperate. \"Good luck, Ron,\" said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek. \"And you, Harry —\" Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall. He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure what had just happened. He seemed too distracted to notice much around him, but Harry cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the words etched onto them: With an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, he hurried Ron across the entrance hall, down the stone steps, and out into the icy air. The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the sloping lawns toward the stadium. There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes. Harry pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked, but he was not sure that Ron was listening. Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered. Harry and Ron pulled on their robes (Ron attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before AliciaTHE LION AND THE SERPENT took pity on him and went to help) and then sat down to listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch. \"Okay, I've only just found out the final lineup for Slytherin,\" said Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment. \"Last year's Beaters, Derrick and Bole, have left now, but it looks as though Montague's replaced them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly particularly well. They're two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don't know much about them —\" \"We do,\" said Harry and Ron together. \"Well, they don't look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from another,\" said Angelina, pocketing her parchment, \"but then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way onto the pitch without signposts.\" \"Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mold,\" Harry assured her. They could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators' stands now. Some people were singing, though Harry could not make out the words. He was starting to feel nervous, but he knew his butterflies were as nothing to Ron's, who was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead again, his jaw set and his complexion pale gray. \"It's time,\" said Angelina in a hushed voice, looking at her watch. \"C'mon everyone . . . good luck.\" The team rose, shouldered their brooms, and marched in single file out of the changing room and into the dazzling sunlight. A roar of sound greeted them in which Harry could still hear singing, though it was muffled by the cheers and whistles. The Slytherin team were standing waiting for them. They too were wearing those silver crown-shaped badges. The new captain, Montague, was built along the same lines as Dudley, with massive forearms like hairy hams. Behind him lurked Crabbe and Goyle, almost as large, blinking stupidly in the sunlight, swinging their new Beaters' bats. Malfoy stood to one side, the sunlight gleaming on his white-blond head. He caught Harry's eye and smirked, tapping the crown-shaped badge on his chest. \"Captains shake hands,\" ordered the umpire, Madam Hooch, as Angelina and Montague reached each other. Harry could tell that Montague was trying to crush Angelina's fingers, though she did not wince. \"Mount your brooms. . . .\" Madam Hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew. The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upward; out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron streak off toward the goal hoops. He zoomed higher, dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide lap of the pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other side of the stadium, Draco Malfoy was doing exactly the same. \"And it's Johnson, Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl is, I've been saying it for years but she still won't go out with me —\" \"JORDAN!\" yelled Professor McGonagall. \"Just a fun fact, Professor, adds a bit of interest — and she's ducked Warrington, she's passed Montague, she's — ouch — been hit from behind by a Bludger from Crabbe. . . . Montague catches the Quaffle, Montague heading back up the pitch and — nice Bludger there from George Weasley, that's a Bludger to the head for Montague, he drops the Quaffle, caught by Katie Bell, Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet's away —\" Lee Jordan's commentary rang through the stadium and Harry listened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and the din of the crowd, all yelling and booing and singing — \"— dodges Warrington, avoids a Bludger — close call, Alicia — and the crowd are loving this, just listen to them, what's that they're singing?\" And as Lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands:THE LION AND THE SERPENT Weasley cannot save a thing, He cannot block a single ring, That's why Slytherins all sing: Weasley is our King. Weasley was born in a bin, He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley will make sure we win, Weasley is our King. \"— and Alicia passes back to Angelina!\" Lee shouted, and as Harry swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee was trying to drown out the sound of the singing. \"Come on now, Angelina — looks like she's got just the Keeper to beat! — SHE SHOOTS — SHE — aaaah . . .\" Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer Ron — Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King. Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search for the Snitch, he turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch, hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted toward him . . . \"— and it's Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington heading for goal, he's out of Bludger range with just the Keeper ahead —\" A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands below: Weasley cannot save a thing, He cannot block a single ring . . . \"— so it's the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, Weasley, brother of Beaters, Fred and George, and a promising new talent on the team — come on, Ron!\" But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin end: Ron had dived wildly, his arms wide, and the Quaffle had soared between them, straight through Ron's central hoop. \"Slytherin score!\" came Lee's voice amid the cheering and booing from the crowds below. \"So that's ten-nil to Slytherin — bad luck, Ron . . .\" The Slytherins sang even louder: WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN, HE ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN . . . \"— and Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell tanking up the pitch —\" cried Lee valiantly, though the singing was now so deafening that he could hardly make himself heard above it. WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN, WEASLEY IS OUR KING . . . \"Harry, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\" screamed Angelina, soaring past him to keep up with Katie. \"GET GOING!\" Harry realized that he had been stationary in midair for more than a minute, watching the progress of the match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the Snitch; horrified, he went into a dive and started circling the pitch again, staring around, trying to ignore the chorus now thundering through the stadium:THE LION AND THE SERPENT WEASLEY IS OUR KING, WEASLEY IS OUR KING . . . There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he looked; Malfoy was still circling the stadium just like Harry. They passed midway around the pitch going in opposite directions and Harry heard Malfoy singing loudly, WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN . . . \"— and it's Warrington again,\" bellowed Lee, \"who passes to Pucey, Pucey's off past Spinnet, come on now Angelina, you can take him — turns out you can't — but nice Bludger from Fred Weasley, I mean, George Weasley, oh who cares, one of them anyway, and Warrington drops the Quaffle and Katie Bell — er — drops it too — so that's Montague with the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Montague takes the Quaffle, and he's off up the pitch, come on now Gryffindor, block him!\" Harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the Slytherin goal hoops, willing himself not to look at what was going on at Ron's end; as he sped past the Slytherin Keeper, he heard Bletchley singing along with the crowd below, WEASLEY CANNOT SAVE A THING . . . \"— and Pucey's dodged Alicia again, and he's heading straight for goal, stop it, Ron!\" Harry did not have to look to see what had happened: There was a terrible groan from the Gryffindor end, coupled with fresh screams and applause from the Slytherins. Looking down, Harry saw the pug-faced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her back to the pitch as she conducted the Slytherin supporters who were roaring: THAT'S WHY SLYTHERINS ALL SING: WEASLEY IS OUR KING. But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch, a few goals and they would be in the lead as usual, Harry assured himself, bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be Montague's watch strap. . . . But Ron let in two more goals. There was an edge of panic in Harry's desire to find the Snitch now. If he could just get it soon and finish the game quickly . . . \"— and Katie Bell of Gryffindor dodges Pucey, ducks Montague, nice swerve, Katie, and she throws to Johnson, Angelina Johnson takes the Quaffle, she's past Warrington, she's heading for goal, come on now Angelina — GRYFFINDOR SCORE! It's forty-ten, forty-ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle. . . .\" Harry could hear Luna's ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the Gryffindor cheers and felt heartened; only thirty points in it, that was nothing, they could pull back easily. Harry ducked a Bludger that Crabbe had sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his frantic scouring of the pitch for the Snitch, keeping one eye on Malfoy in case he showed signs of having spotted it, but Malfoy, like him, was continuing to soar around the stadium, searching fruitlessly . . . \"— Pucey throws to Warrington, Warrington to Montague, Montague back to Pucey — Johnson intervenes, Johnson takes the Quaffle, Johnson to Bell, this looks good — I mean bad — Bell's hit by a Bludger from Goyle of Slytherin and it's Pucey in possession again . . .\" WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN, HE ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN, WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN — &bull; 410 &bull; THE LION AND THE SERPENT But Harry had seen it at last: The tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was hovering feet from the ground at the Slytherin end of the pitch. He dived. . . . In a matter of seconds, Malfoy was streaking out of the sky on Harry's left, a green-and-silver blur lying flat on his broom. . . . The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops and scooted off toward the other side of the stands; its change of direction suited Malfoy, who was nearer. Harry pulled his Firebolt around, he and Malfoy were now neck and neck . . . Feet from the ground, Harry lifted his right hand from his broom, stretching toward the Snitch . . . to his right, Malfoy's arm extended too, reaching, groping . . . It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds — Harry's fingers closed around the tiny, struggling ball — Malfoy's fingernails scrabbled the back of Harry's hand hopelessly — Harry pulled his broom upward, holding the struggling ball in his hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval. . . . They were saved, it did not matter that Ron had let in those goals, nobody would remember as long as Gryffindor had won — WHAM! A Bludger hit Harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew forward off his broom; luckily he was only five or six feet above the ground, having dived so low to catch the Snitch, but he was winded all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch. He heard Madam Hooch's shrill whistle, an uproar in the stands compounded of catcalls, angry yells and jeering, a thud, then Angelina's frantic voice. \"Are you all right?\" \" 'Course I am,\" said Harry grimly, taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his feet. Madam Hooch was zooming toward one of the Slytherin players above him, though he could not see who it was at this angle. \"It was that thug, Crabbe,\" said Angelina angrily. \"He whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you'd got the Snitch — but we won, Harry, we won!\" Harry heard a snort from behind him and turned around, still holding the Snitch tightly in his hand: Draco Malfoy had landed close by; white-faced with fury, he was still managing to sneer. \"Saved Weasley's neck, haven't you?\" he said to Harry. \"I've never seen a worse Keeper . . . but then he was born in a bin. . . . Did you like my lyrics, Potter?\" Harry did not answer; he turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one, yelling and punching the air in triumph, all except Ron, who had dismounted from his broom over by the goalposts and was making his way slowly back to the changing rooms alone. \"We wanted to write another couple of verses!\" Malfoy called, as Katie and Alicia hugged Harry. \"But we couldn't find rhymes for fat and ugly — we wanted to sing about his mother, see —\" \"Talk about sour grapes,\" said Angelina, casting Malfoy a disgusted look. \"— we couldn't fit in useless loser either — for his father, you know —\" Fred and George had realized what Malfoy was talking about. Halfway through shaking Harry's hand they stiffened, looking around at Malfoy. \"Leave it,\" said Angelina at once, taking Fred by the arm. \"Leave it, Fred, let him yell, he's just sore he lost, the jumped-up little —\" \"— but you like the Weasleys, don't you, Potter?\" said Malfoy, sneering. \"Spend holidays there and everything, don't you? Can't see how you stand the stink, but I suppose when you've been dragged up by Muggles even the Weasleys' hovel smells okay —\" Harry grabbed hold of George; meanwhile it was taking the combined efforts of Angelina, Alicia, and Katie to stop Fred leaping onTHE LION AND THE SERPENT Malfoy, who was laughing openly. Harry looked around for Madam Hooch, but she was still berating Crabbe for his illegal Bludger attack. \"Or perhaps,\" said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, \"you can remember what your mother's house stank like, Potter, and Weasley's pigsty reminds you of it —\" Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting at Malfoy. He had completely forgotten the fact that all the teachers were watching: All he wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as possible. With no time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoy's stomach — \"Harry! HARRY! GEORGE! NO !\" He could hear girls' voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George swearing, a whistle blowing, and the bellowing of the crowd around him, but he did not care, not until somebody in the vicinity yelled \"IMPEDIMENTA!\" and only when he was knocked over backward by the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of Malfoy he could reach. . . . \"What do you think you're doing?\" screamed Madam Hooch, as Harry leapt to his feet again; it was she who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx. She was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other, her broom lay abandoned several feet away. Malfoy was curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his nose bloody; George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the background. \"I've never seen behavior like it — back up to the castle, both of you, and straight to your Head of House's office! Go! Now!\" Harry and George marched off the pitch, both panting, neither saying a word to each other. The howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall, where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps. Harry became aware that something was still struggling in his right hand, the knuckles of which he had bruised against Malfoy's jaw; looking down he saw the Snitch's silver wings protruding from between his fingers, struggling for release. They had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagall's office when she came marching along the corridor behind them. She was wearing a Gryffindor scarf, but tore it from her throat with shaking hands as she strode toward them, looking livid. \"In!\" she said furiously, pointing to the door. Harry and George entered. She strode around behind her desk and faced them, quivering with rage as she threw the Gryffindor scarf aside onto the floor. \"Well ?\" she said. \"I have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition. Two onto one! Explain yourselves!\" \"Malfoy provoked us,\" said Harry stiffly. \"Provoked you?\" shouted Professor McGonagall, slamming a fist onto her desk so that her tartan biscuit tin slid sideways off it and burst open, littering the floor with Ginger Newts. \"He'd just lost, hadn't he, of course he wanted to provoke you! But what on earth he can have said that justified what you two —\" \"He insulted my parents,\" snarled George. \"And Harry's mother.\" \"But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling, did you?\" bellowed Professor McGonagall. \"Have you any idea what you've — ?\" \"Hem, hem.\" George and Harry both spun around. Dolores Umbridge was standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced her resemblance to a giant toad, and smiling in the horribly sickly, ominous way that Harry had come to associate with imminent misery. \"May I help, Professor McGonagall?\" asked Professor Umbridge in her most poisonously sweet voice. Blood rushed into Professor McGonagall's face.THE LION AND THE SERPENT \"Help?\" she repeated in a constricted voice. \"What do you mean, &lsquo;help'?\" Professor Umbridge moved forward into the office, still smiling her sickly smile. \"Why, I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority.\" Harry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Professor McGonagall's nostrils. \"You thought wrong,\" she said, turning her back on Umbridge. \"Now, you two had better listen closely. I do not care what provocation Malfoy offered you, I do not care if he insulted every family member you possess, your behavior was disgusting and I am giving each of you a week's worth of detention! Do not look at me like that, Potter, you deserve it! And if either of you ever —\" \"Hem, hem.\" Professor McGonagall closed her eyes as though praying for patience as she turned her face toward Professor Umbridge again. \"Yes?\" \"I think they deserve rather more than detentions,\" said Umbridge, smiling still more broadly. Professor McGonagall's eyes flew open. \"But unfortunately,\" she said, with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her look as though she had lockjaw, \"it is what I think that counts, as they are in my House, Dolores.\" \"Well, actually, Minerva,\" simpered Umbridge, \"I think you'll find that what I think does count. Now, where is it? Cornelius just sent it. . . . I mean,\" she gave a little false laugh as she rummaged in her handbag, \"the Minister just sent it. . . . Ah yes . . .\" She had pulled out a piece of parchment that she now unfurled, clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said. \"Hem, hem . . . &lsquo;Educational Decree Number Twenty-five . . .' \" \"Not another one!\" exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently. \"Well, yes,\" said Umbridge, still smiling. \"As a matter of fact, Minerva, it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment. . . . You remember how you overrode me, when I was unwilling to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form? How you took the case to Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play? Well, now, I couldn't have that. I contacted the Minister at once, and he quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges, or she — that is to say, I — would have less authority than common teachers! And you see now, don't you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor team re-forming? Dreadful tempers . . . Anyway, I was reading out our amendment . . . hem, hem . . . &lsquo;The High Inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments, sanctions, and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts, and the power to alter such punishments, sanctions, and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members. Signed, Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, Order of Merlin First Class, etc., etc. . . .' \" She rolled up the parchment and put it back into her handbag, still smiling. \"So . . . I really think I will have to ban these two from playing Quidditch ever again,\" she said, looking from Harry to George and back again. Harry felt the Snitch fluttering madly in his hand. \"Ban us?\" he said, and his voice sounded strangely distant. \"From playing . . . ever again?\" \"Yes, Mr. Potter, I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick,\" said Umbridge, her smile widening still further as she watched him struggle to comprehend what she had said. \"You and Mr. Weasley here. And I think, to be safe, this young man's twin ought to be stopped too — if his teammates had not restrained him, I feel sure he would have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as well. I will want their broomsticks confiscated, of course; I shall keep them safely in my office, to makeTHE LION AND THE SERPENT sure there is no infringement of my ban. But I am not unreasonable, Professor McGonagall,\" she continued, turning back to Professor McGonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice, staring at her. \"The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no signs of violence from any of them. Well . . . good afternoon to you.\" And with a look of the utmost satisfaction Umbridge left the room, leaving a horrified silence in her wake. \"Banned,\" said Angelina in a hollow voice, late that evening in the common room. \"Banned. No Seeker and no Beaters . . . What on earth are we going to do?\" It did not feel as though they had won the match at all. Everywhere Harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces; the team themselves were slumped around the fire, all apart from Ron, who had not been seen since the end of the match. \"It's just so unfair,\" said Alicia numbly. \"I mean, what about Crabbe and that Bludger he hit after the whistle had been blown? Has she banned him?\" \"No,\" said Ginny miserably; she and Hermione were sitting on either side of Harry. \"He just got lines, I heard Montague laughing about it at dinner.\" \"And banning Fred when he didn't even do anything!\" said Alicia furiously, pummeling her knee with her fist. \"It's not my fault I didn't,\" said Fred, with a very ugly look on his face. \"I would've pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three hadn't been holding me back.\" Harry stared miserably at the dark window. Snow was falling. The Snitch he had caught earlier was now zooming around and around the common room; people were watching its progress as though hypnotized and Crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair, trying to catch it. \"I'm going to bed,\" said Angelina, getting slowly to her feet. \"Maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream. . . . Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow and find we haven't played yet. . . .\" She was soon followed by Alicia and Katie. Fred and George sloped off to bed some time later, glowering at everyone they passed, and Ginny went not long after that. Only Harry and Hermione were left beside the fire. \"Have you seen Ron?\" Hermione asked in a low voice. Harry shook his head. \"I think he's avoiding us,\" said Hermione. \"Where do you think he — ?\" But at that precise moment, there was a creaking sound behind them as the Fat Lady swung forward and Ron came clambering through the portrait hole. He was very pale indeed and there was snow in his hair. When he saw Harry and Hermione he stopped dead in his tracks. \"Where have you been?\" said Hermione anxiously, springing up. \"Walking,\" Ron mumbled. He was still wearing his Quidditch things. \"You look frozen,\" said Hermione. \"Come and sit down!\" Ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from Harry's, not looking at him. The stolen Snitch zoomed over their heads. \"I'm sorry,\" Ron mumbled, looking at his feet. \"What for?\" said Harry. \"For thinking I can play Quidditch,\" said Ron. \"I'm going to resign first thing tomorrow.\" \"If you resign,\" said Harry testily, \"there'll only be three players left on the team.\" And when Ron looked puzzled, he said, \"I've been given a lifetime ban. So've Fred and George.\" \"What?\" Ron yelped. Hermione told him the full story; Harry could not bear to tell it again. When she had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever.THE LION AND THE SERPENT \"This is all my fault —\" \"You didn't make me punch Malfoy,\" said Harry angrily. \"— if I wasn't so lousy at Quidditch —\" \"— it's got nothing to do with that —\" \"— it was that song that wound me up —\" \"— it would've wound anyone up —\" Hermione got up and walked to the window, away from the argument, watching the snow swirling down against the pane. \"Look, drop it, will you!\" Harry burst out. \"It's bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything!\" Ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his robes. After a while he said in a dull voice, \"This is the worst I've ever felt in my life.\" \"Join the club,\" said Harry bitterly. \"Well,\" said Hermione, her voice trembling slightly. \"I can think of one thing that might cheer you both up.\" \"Oh yeah?\" said Harry skeptically. \"Yeah,\" said Hermione, turning away from the pitch-black, snow-flecked window, a broad smile spreading across her face. \"Hagrid's back.\"\n",

      "Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china: He had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door. \"What the — ?\" He looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley's idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap. It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic . . . but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came to think of it — particularly in light of his immediate plans — this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him. Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom — old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood. He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather's last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit. Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning's Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk. It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the Marauder's Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable — in all usual senses it was worthless — but because of what it had cost to attain it. This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer. He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers, throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one. The owl was asleep, or else faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment. As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for. ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED by Elphias Doge I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles. Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to praise his father's action and assumed that Albus too was a Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mistaken: As anybody who knew Albus would attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, his determined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years. In a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching. He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore's future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial ambitions. Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus's brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus's shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother. When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then-traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra's funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me. That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward the end of my year's travels, that yet another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana. Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of her brothers. All those closest to Albus — and I count myself one of that lucky number — agree that Ariana's death, and Albus's feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore. I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person's suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less lighthearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would lift — in later years they reestablished, if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to mention them. Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore's innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle. Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world's. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him. Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar,  kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined Dumbledore's childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, Harry's past, Harry's future, Harry's plans . . . and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered honestly: \"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \"I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" After several minutes' thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts. Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left out of place were today's Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror. Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today's Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed. Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried: DUMBLEDORE — THE TRUTH AT LAST? Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation. Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave. WHY was the man tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end? The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page 13, inside. Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on. In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious quill-portraits might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home, she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip. \"Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer's dream,\" says Skeeter. \"Such a long, full life. I'm sure my book will be the first of very, very many.\" Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine-hundred-page book was completed a mere four weeks after Dumbledore's mysterious death in June. I ask her how she managed this superfast feat. \"Oh, when you've been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is second nature. I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be the first to meet that need.\" I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore's, that \"Skeeter's book contains less fact than a Chocolate Frog card.\" Skeeter throws back her head and laughs. \"Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights, bless him. Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout.\" And yet Elphias Doge's accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of Dumbledore's long and extraordinary life? \"Oh, my dear,\" beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles, \"you know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word &lsquo;no,' and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought he was so wonderful, you know — he trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I've had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth.\" The advance publicity for Skeeter's biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a blameless life. What were the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask? \"Now, come off it, Betty, I'm not giving away all the highlights before anybody's bought the book!\" laughs Skeeter. \"But I can promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! Let's just say that nobody hearing him rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn't exactly broad-minded when he was younger! Yes, Al-bus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.\" I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago. \"Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,\" laughs Skeeter. \"No, no, I'm talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats, worse even than the Mugglemaiming father — Dumbledore couldn't keep either of them quiet anyway, they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it's the mother and the sister that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness — but, as I say, you'll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it's no wonder Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken.\" Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to Dumbledore's many magical discoveries? \"He had brains,\" she concedes, \"although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon's blood when Dumbledore &lsquo;borrowed' his papers.\" But the importance of some of Dumbledore's achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald? \"Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald,\" says Skeeter with a tantalizing smile. \"I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell — or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I'll say is, don't be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend. After they've read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!\" Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject, so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other. \"Oh yes,\" says Skeeter, nodding briskly, \"I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy's best interests — well, we'll see. It's certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.\" I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned. \"Oh, yes, we've developed a close bond,\" says Skeeter. \"Poor Potter has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life — the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.\" Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Dumbledore's final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died? \"Well, I don't want to say too much — it's all in the book — but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it seems? That is for the Wizarding community to decide — once they've read my book.\" On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller. Dumbledore's legions of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero. Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin. He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from Rita's article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship . . . It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. . . . He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth . . . I've had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for . . . \"Lies!\" Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously. Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming him. . . . A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia's choosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him. He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce him again.\n",

      "For the rest of the week's Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince's instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage's, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harry's abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the \"official\" instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's. Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself. \"Or herself,\" said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. \"It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl's than a boy's.\" \"The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,\" Harry said. \"How many girls have been Princes?\" Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down. Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag. \"It's five to eight, I'd better go, I'll be late for Dumbledore.\" \"Ooooh!\" gasped Hermione, looking up at once. \"Good luck! We'll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!\" \"Hope it goes okay,\" said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole. Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked. \"Two of spades: conflict,\" she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. \"Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner —\" She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry's statue. \"Well, that can't be right,\" she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall. \"Acid Pops,\" said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore's office. Harry knocked. \"Come in,\" said Dumbledore's voice. \"Good evening, sir,\" said Harry, walking into the headmaster's office. \"Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"I hope you've had an enjoyable first week back at school?\" \"Yes, thanks, sir,\" said Harry. \"You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!\" \"Er,\" began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern. \"I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.\" \"Right,\" said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snape's detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore's magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice. \"So, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. \"You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these — for want of a better word — lessons?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.\" There was a pause. \"You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything,\" said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice. \"Sir,\" he added. \"And so I did,\" said Dumbledore placidly. \"I told you everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.\" \"But you think you're right?\" said Harry. \"Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.\" \"Sir,\" said Harry tentatively, \"does what you're going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive?\" \"It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,\" said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next day's weather, \"and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.\" Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry. \"You look worried.\" Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling. \"This time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission.\" \"Where are we going, sir?\" \"For a trip down Bob Ogden's memory lane,\" said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery-white substance. \"Who was Bob Ogden?\" \"He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\" said Dumbledore. \"He died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry . . .\" But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful. \"Shall — shall I, sir?\" \"No matter, Harry —\" Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out. \"Sir — how did you injure your hand?\" Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity. \"Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have an appointment with Bob Ogden.\" Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas. \"After you,\" said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl. Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him. They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forgetme-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before  Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane. Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile. They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge. Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. \"You're not welcome.\" The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke. \"Er — good morning. I'm from the Ministry of Magic —\" \"You're not welcome.\" \"Er — I'm sorry — I don't understand you,\" said Ogden nervously. Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry's opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other. \"You understand him, I'm sure, Harry?\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Yes, of course,\" said Harry, slightly nonplussed. \"Why can't Ogden — ?\" But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood. \"He's speaking Parseltongue?\" \"Very good,\" said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other. \"Now, look —\" Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers. \"Morfin!\" said a loud voice. An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground. \"Ministry, is it?\" said the older man, looking down at Ogden. \"Correct!\" said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. \"And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?\" \"S'right,\" said Gaunt. \"Got you in the face, did he?\" \"Yes, he did!\" snapped Ogden. \"Should've made your presence known, shouldn't you?\" said Gaunt aggressively. \"This is private property. Can't just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.\" \"Defend himself against what, man?\" said Ogden, clambering back to his feet. \"Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.\" Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. \"Get in the house. Don't argue.\" This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again. \"It's your son I'm here to see, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. \"That was Morfin, wasn't it?\" \"Ar, that was Morfin,\" said the old man indifferently. \"Are you pure-blood?\" he asked, suddenly aggressive. \"That's neither here nor there,\" said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently. He squinted into Ogden's face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, \"Now I come to think about it, I've seen noses like yours down in the village.\" \"I don't doubt it, if your son's been let loose on them,\" said Ogden. \"Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?\" \"Inside?\" \"Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I've already told you. I'm here about Morfin. We sent an owl —\" \"I've no use for owls,\" said Gaunt. \"I don't open letters.\" \"Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,\" said Ogden tartly. \"I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning —\" \"All right, all right, all right!\" bellowed Gaunt. \"Come in the bleeding house, then, and much good it'll do you!\" The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room combined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue: Hissy, hissy, little snakey, Slither on the floor, You be good to Morfin Or he'll nail you to the door. There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother's, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person. \"M'daughter, Merope,\" said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her. \"Good morning,\" said Ogden. She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her. \"Well, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, \"to get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night.\" There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots. \"Pick it up!\" Gaunt bellowed at her. \"That's it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, what's your wand for, you useless sack of muck?\" \"Mr. Gaunt, please!\" said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two. Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, \"Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!\" Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, \"Reparo.\" The pot mended itself instantly. Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his daughter, \"Lucky the nice man from the Ministry's here, isn't it? Perhaps he'll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn't mind dirty Squibs. . . .\" Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish. \"Mr. Gaunt,\" Ogden began again, \"as I've said: the reason for my visit —\" \"I heard you the first time!\" snapped Gaunt. \"And so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him — what about it, then?\" \"Morfin has broken Wizarding law,\" said Ogden sternly. \" &lsquo;Morfin has broken Wizarding law.' \" Gaunt imitated Ogden's voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again. \"He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that's illegal now, is it?\" \"Yes,\" said Ogden. \"I'm afraid it is.\" He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it. \"What's that, then, his sentence?\" said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily. \"It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing —\" \"Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?\" \"I'm Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,\" said Ogden. \"And you think we're scum, do you?\" screamed Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow-nailed finger pointing at his chest. \"Scum who'll come running when the Ministry tells 'em to? Do you know who you're talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you? \"I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground. \"That's right!\" roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden's eyes. \"See this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it's been in our family, that's how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I've been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?\" \"I've really no idea,\" said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, \"and it's quite beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed —\" With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck. \"See this?\" he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath. \"I see it, I see it!\" said Ogden hastily. \"Slytherin's!\" yelled Gaunt. \"Salazar Slytherin's! We're his last living descendants, what do you say to that, eh?\" \"Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!\" said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air. \"So!\" said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute. \"Don't you go talking to us as if we're dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all — more than you can say, I don't doubt!\" And he spat on the floor at Ogden's feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing. \"Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden doggedly, \"I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our information\" — he glanced down at his scroll of parchment — \"is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.\" Morfin giggled. \"Be quiet, boy,\" snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again. \"And so what if he did, then?\" Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden. \"I expect you've wiped the Muggle's filthy face clean for him, and his memory to boot —\" \"That's hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?\" said Ogden. \"This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless —\" \"Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you,\" sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again. \"This discussion is getting us nowhere,\" said Ogden firmly. \"It is clear from your son's attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.\" He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. \"Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg —\" Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white. \"My God, what an eyesore!\" rang out a girl's voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. \"Couldn't your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?\" \"It's not ours,\" said a young man's voice. \"Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The son's quite mad, you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village —\" The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of his armchair. \"Keep your seat,\" said his father warningly, in Parseltongue. \"Tom,\" said the girl's voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, \"I might be wrong — but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?\" \"Good lord, you're right!\" said the man's voice. \"That'll be the son, I told you he's not right in the head. Don't look at it, Cecilia, darling.\" The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing fainter again. \"&lsquo;Darling,' \" whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his sister. \" &lsquo;Darling,' he called her. So he wouldn't have you anyway.\" Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint. \"What's that?\" said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. \"What did you say, Morfin?\" \"She likes looking at that Muggle,\" said Morfin, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified. \"Always in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at him, isn't she? And last night —\" Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, \"Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasn't she?\" \"Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?\" said Gaunt quietly. All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping. \"Is it true?\" said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. \"My daughter — pure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin — hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?\" Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak. \"But I got him, Father!\" cackled Morfin. \"I got him as he went by and he didn't look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Merope?\" \"You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!\" roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughter's throat. Both Harry and Ogden yelled \"No!\" at the same time; Ogden raised his wand and cried, \"Relashio!\" Gaunt was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand. Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope's screams echoing in his ears. Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse's flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane. \"I think that will do, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in Dumbledore's now twilit office. \"What happened to the girl in the cottage?\" said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. \"Merope, or whatever her name was?\" \"Oh, she survived,\" said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. \"Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.\" \"Marvolo?\" Harry repeated wonderingly. \"That's right,\" said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. \"I am glad to see you're keeping up.\" \"That old man was — ?\" \"Voldemort's grandfather, yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.\" \"So Merope,\" said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and staring at Dumbledore, \"so Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Voldemort's mother?\" \"It does,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort's father. I wonder whether you noticed?\" \"The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?\" \"Very good indeed,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.\" \"And they ended up married?\" Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. \"I think you are forgetting,\" said Dumbledore, \"that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years. \"Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?\" \"The Imperius Curse?\" Harry suggested. \"Or a love potion?\" \"Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire's son ran off with the tramp's daughter, Merope. \"But the villagers' shock was nothing to Marvolo's. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done. \"From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death — or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage.\" \"And Merope? She . . . she died, didn't she? Wasn't Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said Dumbledore. \"We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being &lsquo;hoodwinked' and &lsquo;taken in.' What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.\" \"But she did have his baby.\" \"But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.\" \"What went wrong?\" asked Harry. \"Why did the love potion stop working?\" \"Again, this is guesswork,\" said Dumbledore, \"but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby's sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son.\" The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore's office seemed to glow more brightly than before. \"I think that will do for tonight, Harry,\" said Dumbledore after a moment or two. \"Yes, sir,\" said Harry. He got to his feet, but did not leave. \"Sir . . . is it important to know all this about Voldemort's past?\" \"Very important, I think,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it . . . it's got something to do with the prophecy?\" \"It has everything to do with the prophecy.\" \"Right,\" said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same. He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. \"Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you've told me?\" Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, \"Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort's secrets.\" \"No, sir, I'll make sure it's just Ron and Hermione. Good night.\" He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle-legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a large, cracked, black stone. \"Sir,\" said Harry, staring at it. \"That ring —\" \"Yes?\" said Dumbledore. \"You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.\" \"So I was,\" Dumbledore agreed. \"But isn't it . . . sir, isn't it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?\" Dumbledore bowed his head. \"The very same.\" \"But how come — ? Have you always had it?\" \"No, I acquired it very recently,\" said Dumbledore. \"A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle's, in fact.\" \"That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?\" \"Around that time, yes, Harry.\" Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling. \"Sir, how exactly — ?\" \"Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good night.\" \"Good night, sir.\"\n",

      "Harry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes. Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys' kitchen fire. \"Did he eat it?\" said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his feet. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, straightening up. \"What was it?\" \"Ton-Tongue Toffee,\" said Fred brightly. \"George and I invented them, and we've been looking for someone to test them on all summer. . . .\" The tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers. \"How're you doing, Harry?\" said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weatherbeaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it. Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry's hand. Bill came as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was — there was no other word for it — cool. He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. Bill's clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide. Before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise, and Mr. Weasley appeared out of thin air at George's shoulder. He was looking angrier than Harry had ever seen him. \"That wasn't funny, Fred!\" he shouted. \"What on earth did you give that Muggle boy?\" \"I didn't give him anything,\" said Fred, with another evil grin. \"I WEASLEYS' WIZARD WHEEZES just dropped it. . . . It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told him to.\" \"You dropped it on purpose!\" roared Mr. Weasley. \"You knew he'd eat it, you knew he was on a diet —\" \"How big did his tongue get?\" George asked eagerly. \"It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it!\" Harry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again. \"It isn't funny!\" Mr. Weasley shouted. \"That sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard&ndash;Muggle relations! I spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons —\" \"We didn't give it to him because he's a Muggle!\" said Fred indignantly. \"No, we gave it to him because he's a great bullying git,\" said George. \"Isn't he, Harry?\" \"Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,\" said Harry earnestly. \"That's not the point!\" raged Mr. Weasley. \"You wait until I tell your mother —\" \"Tell me what?\" said a voice behind them. Mrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short, plump woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion. \"Oh hello, Harry, dear,\" she said, spotting him and smiling. Then her eyes snapped back to her husband. \"Tell me what, Arthur?\" Mr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry he was with Fred and George, he hadn't really intended to tell Mrs. Weasley what had happened. There was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife nervously. Then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry's and Ron's friend, Hermione Granger. The other, who was small and red-haired, was Ron's younger sister, Ginny. Both of them smiled at Harry, who grinned back, which made Ginny go scarlet — she had been very taken with Harry ever since his first visit to the Burrow. \"Tell me what, Arthur?\" Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of voice. \"It's nothing, Molly,\" mumbled Mr. Weasley, \"Fred and George just — but I've had words with them —\" \"What have they done this time?\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"If it's got anything to do with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes —\" \"Why don't you show Harry where he's sleeping, Ron?\" said Hermione from the doorway. \"He knows where he's sleeping,\" said Ron, \"in my room, he slept there last —\" \"We can all go,\" said Hermione pointedly. \"Oh,\" said Ron, cottoning on. \"Right.\" \"Yeah, we'll come too,\" said George. \"You stay where you are!\" snarled Mrs. Weasley. Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories. \"What are Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes?\" Harry asked as they climbed. Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn't. \"Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaningWEASLEYS' WIZARD WHEEZES Fred and George's room,\" said Ron quietly. \"Great long price lists for stuff they've invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they'd been inventing all that . . .\" \"We've been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things,\" said Ginny. \"We thought they just liked the noise.\" \"Only, most of the stuff — well, all of it, really — was a bit dangerous,\" said Ron, \"and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren't allowed to make any more of it, and burned all the order forms. . . . She's furious at them anyway. They didn't get as many O.W.L.s as she expected.\" O.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen. \"And then there was this big row,\" Ginny said, \"because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop.\" Just then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression. \"Hi, Percy,\" said Harry. \"Oh hello, Harry,\" said Percy. \"I was wondering who was making all the noise. I'm trying to work in here, you know — I've got a report to finish for the office — and it's rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs.\" \"We're not thundering,\" said Ron irritably. \"We're walking. Sorry if we've disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.\" \"What are you working on?\" said Harry. \"A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,\" said Percy smugly. \"We're trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year —\" \"That'll change the world, that report will,\" said Ron. \"Front page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks.\" Percy went slightly pink. \"You might sneer, Ron,\" he said heatedly, \"but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously endanger —\" \"Yeah, yeah, all right,\" said Ron, and he started off upstairs again. Percy slammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them. It sounded as though Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the toffees. The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had the last time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ron's favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog. Ron's old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron's letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly. \"Shut up, Pig,\" said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room. \"Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,\" heWEASLEYS' WIZARD WHEEZES told Harry. \"Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he's got to work.\" \"Er — why are you calling that owl Pig?\" Harry asked Ron. \"Because he's being stupid,\" said Ginny. \"Its proper name is Pigwidgeon.\" \"Yeah, and that's not a stupid name at all,\" said Ron sarcastically. \"Ginny named him,\" he explained to Harry. \"She reckons it's sweet. And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won't answer to anything else. So now he's Pig. I've got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to that.\" Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously. He had moaned continually about his old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him. \"Where's Crookshanks?\" Harry asked Hermione now. \"Out in the garden, I expect,\" she said. \"He likes chasing gnomes. He's never seen any before.\" \"Percy's enjoying work, then?\" said Harry, sitting down on one of the beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling. \"Enjoying it?\" said Ron darkly. \"I don't reckon he'd come home if Dad didn't make him. He's obsessed. Just don't get him onto the subject of his boss. According to Mr. Crouch . . . as I was saying to Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Crouch is of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch was telling me . . . They'll be announcing their engagement any day now.\" \"Have you had a good summer, Harry?\" said Hermione. \"Did you get our food parcels and everything?\" \"Yeah, thanks a lot,\" said Harry. \"They saved my life, those cakes.\" \"And have you heard from — ?\" Ron began, but at a look from Hermione he fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry's godfather as he was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody but themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence. \"I think they've stopped arguing,\" said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry. \"Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?\" \"Yeah, all right,\" said Ron. The four of them left Ron's room and went back downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad-tempered. \"We're eating out in the garden,\" she said when they came in. \"There's just not room for eleven people in here. Could you take the plates outside, girls? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and forks, please, you two,\" she said to Ron and Harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling. \"Oh for heaven's sake,\" she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor, scooping up the potatoes. \"Those two!\" she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and George. \"I don't know what's going to happen to them, I really don't. No ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can. . . .\" Mrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on theWEASLEYS' WIZARD WHEEZES kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred. \"It's not as though they haven't got brains,\" she continued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, \"but they're wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they'll be in real trouble. I've had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together. If they carry on the way they're going, they'll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office.\" Mrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open. Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan. \"I don't know where we went wrong with them,\" said Mrs. Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. \"It's been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won't listen to — OH NOT AGAIN !\" She had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse. \"One of their fake wands again!\" she shouted. \"How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around?\" She grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking. \"C'mon,\" Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, \"let's go and help Bill and Charlie.\" They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard. They had only gone a few paces when Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other's out of the air. Fred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety. Bill's table caught Charlie's with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off. There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy's head poking out of a window on the second floor. \"Will you keep it down?!\" he bellowed. \"Sorry, Perce,\" said Bill, grinning. \"How're the cauldron bottoms coming on?\" \"Very badly,\" said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere. By seven o'clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs. Weasley's excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys,WEASLEYS' WIZARD WHEEZES Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad. At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms. \"I've told Mr. Crouch that I'll have it ready by Tuesday,\" Percy was saying pompously. \"That's a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of things. I think he'll be grateful I've done it in good time, I mean, it's extremely busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup. We're just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Ludo Bagman —\" \"I like Ludo,\" said Mr. Weasley mildly. \"He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into a spot of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I smoothed the whole thing over.\" \"Oh Bagman's likable enough, of course,\" said Percy dismissively, \"but how he ever got to be Head of Department . . . when I compare him to Mr. Crouch! I can't see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what's happened to them. You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back?\" \"Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,\" said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \"He says Bertha's gotten lost plenty of times before now — though I must say, if it was someone in my department, I'd be worried. . . .\" \"Oh Bertha's hopeless, all right,\" said Percy. \"I hear she's been shunted from department to department for years, much more trouble than she's worth . . . but all the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find her. Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest, she worked in our department at one time, you know, and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania. However\" — Percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine — \"we've got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too. As you know, we've got another big event to organize right after the World Cup.\" Percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the table where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting. \"You know the one I'm talking about, Father.\" He raised his voice slightly. \"The top-secret one.\" Ron rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione, \"He's been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work. Probably an exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.\" In the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing with Bill about his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition. \". . . with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what do they say at the bank?\" \"Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure,\" said Bill patiently. \"And your hair's getting silly, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley, fingering her wand lovingly. \"I wish you'd let me give it a trim. . . .\" \"I like it,\" said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. \"You're so old-fashioned, Mum. Anyway, it's nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore's. . . .\"WEASLEYS' WIZARD WHEEZES Next to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking spiritedly about the World Cup. \"It's got to be Ireland,\" said Charlie thickly, through a mouthful of potato. \"They flattened Peru in the semifinals.\" \"Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,\" said Fred. \"Krum's one decent player, Ireland has got seven,\" said Charlie shortly. \"I wish England had got through. That was embarrassing, that was.\" \"What happened?\" said Harry eagerly, regretting more than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck on Privet Drive. \"Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten,\" said Charlie gloomily. \"Shocking performance. And Wales lost to Uganda, and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg.\" Harry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his first year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world, a Firebolt. Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything else in the magical world, and he played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team. Mr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks. Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, \"So — have you heard from Sirius lately?\" Hermione looked around, listening closely. \"Yeah,\" said Harry softly, \"twice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him yesterday. He might write back while I'm here.\" He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and about the dream that had awoken him . . . but he really didn't want to worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful. \"Look at the time,\" Mrs. Weasley said suddenly, checking her wristwatch. \"You really should be in bed, the whole lot of you — you'll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your school list out, I'll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley. I'm getting everyone else's. There might not be time after the World Cup, the match went on for five days last time.\" \"Wow — hope it does this time!\" said Harry enthusiastically. \"Well, I certainly don't,\" said Percy sanctimoniously. \"I shudder to think what the state of my in-tray would be if I was away from work for five days.\" \"Yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, Perce?\" said Fred. \"That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!\" said Percy, going very red in the face. \"It was nothing personal !\" \"It was,\" Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table. \"We sent it.\"\n",

      "Harry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered again. Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out onto the landing, and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher's ancestors, and into the kitchen. He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and when he pushed it open he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment he entered. \"Breakfast,\" she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire. \"M-m-morning, Harry,\" yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning. \"Sleep all right?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"I've b-b-been up all night,\" she said, with another shuddering yawn. \"Come and sit down. . . .\" She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process. \"What do you want, Harry?\" Mrs. Weasley called. \"Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?\" \"Just — just toast, thanks,\" said Harry. Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, \"What were you saying about Scrimgeour?\" \"Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he's been asking Kingsley and me funny questions. . . .\" Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn't. \". . . and I'll have to tell Dumbledore I can't do night duty tomorrow, I'm just t-t-too tired,\" Tonks finished, yawning hugely again. \"I'll cover for you,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I'm okay, I've got a report to finish anyway. . . .\" Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard's robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry. \"How are you feeling?\" Harry shrugged. \"It'll all be over soon,\" Mr. Weasley said bracingly. \"In a few hours' time you'll be cleared.\" Harry said nothing. \"The hearing's on my floor, in Amelia Bones's office. She's Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she's the one who'll be questioning you.\" \"Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,\" said Tonks earnestly. \"She's fair, she'll hear you out.\" Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say. \"Don't lose your temper,\" said Sirius abruptly. \"Be polite and stick to the facts.\" Harry nodded again. \"The law's on your side,\" said Lupin quietly. \"Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.\" Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry's neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him again, then he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head. \"Doesn't it ever lie flat?\" she said desperately. Harry shook his head. Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry. \"I think we'll go now,\" he said. \"We're a bit early, but I think you'll be better off there than hanging around here.\" \"Okay,\" said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet. \"You'll be all right, Harry,\" said Tonks, patting him on the arm. \"Good luck,\" said Lupin. \"I'm sure it will be fine.\" \"And if it's not,\" said Sirius grimly, \"I'll see to Amelia Bones for you. . . .\" Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him. \"We've all got our fingers crossed,\" she said. \"Right,\" said Harry. \"Well . . . see you later then.\" He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear Sirius's mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn. \"You don't normally walk to work, do you?\" Harry asked him, as they set off briskly around the square. \"No, I usually Apparate,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"but obviously you can't, and I think it's best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . makes a better impression, given what you're being disciplined for. . . .\" Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Underground station they found it already full of early morning commuters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm. \"Simply fabulous,\" he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. \"Wonderfully ingenious.\" \"They're out of order,\" said Harry, pointing at the sign. \"Yes, but even so . . .\" said Mr. Weasley, beaming fondly at them. They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London. Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the Underground map above the windows. \"Four stops, Harry . . . three stops left now . . . two stops to go, Harry . . .\" They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up  the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged onto a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings, already full of traffic. \"Where are we?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley's continual references to the map; but a second later he said, \"Ah yes . . . this way, Harry,\" and led him down a side road. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I've never even used the visitor's entrance before.\" The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic. \"Here we are,\" said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffittied wall. \"After you, Harry.\" He opened the telephone box door. Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr. Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver. \"Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,\" Harry said. \"No, no, I'm sure it's fine,\" said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. \"Let's see . . . six . . .\" he dialed the number, \"two . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another two . . .\" As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr. Weasley's hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them. \"Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.\" \"Er . . .\" said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he should talk into the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, \"Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing. . . .\" \"Thank you,\" said the cool female voice. \"Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes.\" There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: It was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again. \"Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.\" The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes from watering. \"The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,\" said the woman's voice. The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open. They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and changing like some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart. Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat, and each of the house-elf's ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall. \"This way,\" said Mr. Weasley. They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, others battered briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as they walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A small, smudged sign beside it read: All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries If I'm not expelled from Hogwarts, I'll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately. \"Over here, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying security. A badly shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet. \"I'm escorting a visitor,\" said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry. \"Step over here,\" said the wizard in a bored voice. Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry's front and back. \"Wand,\" grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand. Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it. \"Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That correct?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry nervously. \"I keep this,\" said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike. \"You get this back,\" he added, thrusting the wand at Harry. \"Thank you.\" \"Hang on. . . .\" said the wizard slowly. His eyes had darted from the silver visitor's badge on Harry's chest to his forehead. \"Thank you, Eric,\" said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the shoulder, he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates. Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around one of them. A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises. \"All right, Arthur?\" said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley. \"What've you got there, Bob?\" asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the box. \"We're not sure,\" said the wizard seriously. \"We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.\" With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley moved inside it with the rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against the back wall of the lift. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone's eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling all the while, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again. \"Level seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.\" The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls; one of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upward again, and the woman's voice said, \"Level six, Department of Magical Transport, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Center.\" Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several paper airplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet color and he could see ministry of magic stamped along the edges of their wings. \"Just Interdepartmental memos,\" Mr. Weasley muttered to him. \"We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings all over the desks . . .\" As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped around the swaying lamp in the lift's ceiling. \"Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.\" When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they darted around it. \"Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.\" \" 'S'cuse,\" said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet again. \"Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.\" Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the ground. The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors opened and the voice said, \"Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.\" \"This is us, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. \"My office is on the other side of the floor.\" \"Mr. Weasley,\" said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, \"aren't we underground?\" \"Yes, we are,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"those are enchanted windows; Magical Maintenance decide what weather we're getting every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay raise. . . . Just round here, Harry.\" They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors, and emerged in a cluttered, open area divided into cubicles, which were buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquarters. Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill's was sitting with his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther along, a witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt. \"Morning, Weasley,\" said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. \"I've been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?\" \"Yes, if it really is a second,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"I'm in rather a hurry.\" They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle. Harry received a slight shock; Sirius's face was blinking down at him from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs — even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters' wedding — papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels. \"Here,\" said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand, \"I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We've received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.\" Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, \"Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.\" Then he said in normal tones, \"And don't take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.\" \"If you had read my report you would know that the term is &lsquo;firearms,' \" said Mr. Weasley coolly. \"And I'm afraid you'll have to wait for information on motorcycles, we're extremely busy at the moment.\" He dropped his voice and said, \"If you can get away before seven, Molly's making meatballs.\" He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley's cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artifacts. Mr. Weasley's dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley's obsessions; there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children's books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug. Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley's overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it. \"We haven't got a window,\" said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. \"We've asked, but they don't seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesn't look as if Perkins is in yet.\" Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins's desk while Mr. Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shackle-bolt had given him. \"Ah,\" he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst, \"yes . . .\" He flicked through it. \"Yes, he's right, I'm sure Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear, what's this now?\" A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and read aloud, \" &lsquo;Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately.' This is getting ridiculous. . . .\" \"A regurgitating toilet?\" \"Anti-Muggle pranksters,\" said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \"We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing — well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those — those pumbles, I think they're called — you know, the ones who mend pipes and things —\" \"Plumbers?\" \"— exactly, yes, but of course they're flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever's doing it.\" \"Will it be Aurors who catch them?\" \"Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol — ah, Harry, this is Perkins.\" A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room, panting. \"Oh Arthur!\" he said desperately, without looking at Harry. \"Thank goodness, I didn't know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not, I've just sent an owl to your home but you've obviously missed it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago —\" \"I know about the regurgitating toilet,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"No, no, it's not the toilet, it's the Potter boy's hearing — they've changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o'clock now and it's down in old Courtroom Ten —\" \"Down in old — but they told me — Merlin's beard —\" Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his chair. \"Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!\" Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley left the office at a run, Harry on his heels. \"Why have they changed the time?\" Harry said breathlessly as they hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at Perkins's desk. \"I've no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you'd missed it it would have been catastrophic!\" Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button. \"Come ON!\" The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button. \"Those courtrooms haven't been used in years,\" said Mr. Weasley angrily. \"I can't think why they're doing it down there — unless — but no . . .\" A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment, and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate. \"The Atrium,\" said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face got in. \"Morning, Arthur,\" he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend. \"Don't often see you down here. . . .\" \"Urgent business, Bode,\" said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry. \"Ah, yes,\" said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. \"Of course.\" Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable. \"Department of Mysteries,\" said the cool female voice, and left it at that. \"Quick, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps. \"Down here, down here,\" panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at a time. \"The lift doesn't even come down this far . . . why they're doing it there . . .\" They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor, which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape's dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets. The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes. \"Courtroom . . . ten . . . I think . . . we're nearly . . . yes.\" Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest. \"Go on,\" he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. \"Get in there.\" \"Aren't — aren't you coming with — ?\" \"No, no, I'm not allowed. Good luck!\" Harry's heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam's apple. He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped inside the courtroom.\n",

      "They had expected to have to comb Hermione's Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Um-bridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline: MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER \"HIGH INQUISITOR\" \" &lsquo;High Inquisitor'?\" said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast slipping from his fingers. \"What does that mean?\" Hermione read aloud: \"In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \"&lsquo;The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at HogwartsTHE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR for some time,' said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. &lsquo;He is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve.' \"This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person. \"&lsquo;That's how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,' said Weasley last night. &lsquo;Dumbledore couldn't find anyone, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she's been an immediate success —' \" \"She's been a WHAT?\" said Harry loudly. \"Wait, there's more,\" said Hermione grimly. \" &lsquo;— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-theground feedback about what's really happening at Hogwarts.' \"It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new position of &lsquo;Hogwarts High Inquisitor.' \"&lsquo;This is an exciting new phase in the Minister's plan to get to grips with what some are calling the \"falling standards\" at Hogwarts,' said Weasley. &lsquo;The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post, and we are delighted to say that she has accepted.' \"The Ministry's new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts. \"&lsquo;I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,' said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. &lsquo;Many of us with our children's best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore's eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.' \"Among those &lsquo;eccentric decisions' are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional ex-Auror &lsquo;Mad-Eye' Moody. \"Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts. \"&lsquo;I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,' said a Ministry insider last night. \"Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts. \"&lsquo;Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge's office,' said Madam Marchbanks. &lsquo;This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Al-bus Dumbledore.' (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks' alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17).\" Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two. \"So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed this &lsquo;Educational Decree' and forced her on us! And now he's given her the power to inspect other teachers!\" Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright. \"I can't believe this. It's outrageous. . . .\" \"I know it is,\" said Harry. He looked down at his right hand, clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin. But a grin was unfurling on Ron's face. \"What?\" said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him. \"Oh, I can't wait to see McGonagall inspected,\" said Ron happily. \"Umbridge won't know what's hit her.\"THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR \"Well, come on,\" said Hermione, jumping up, \"we'd better get going, if she's inspecting Binns's class we don't want to be late. . . .\" But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in Snape's dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry's moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner. \"I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,\" said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, passing back their homework. \"This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.\" Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them. \"The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week's essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D's.\" He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, \"Some people got D's? Ha!\" Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information private. Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione's but it was at least blue rather than pink, like Neville's, and he delivered a flask of it to Snape's desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief. \"Well, that wasn't as bad as last week, was it?\" said Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall toward lunch. \"And the homework didn't go too badly either, did it?\" When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, \"I mean, all right, I didn't expect the top grade, not if he's marking to O.W.L. standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn't you say?\" Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat. \"Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we've got plenty of time to improve, but the grades we're getting now are a sort of baseline, aren't they? Something we can build on . . .\" They sat down together at the Gryffindor table. \"Obviously, I'd have been thrilled if I'd gotten an O —\" \"Hermione,\" said Ron sharply, \"if you want to know what grades we got, ask.\" \"I don't — I didn't mean — well, if you want to tell me —\" \"I got a P,\" said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. \"Happy?\" \"Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of,\" said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry's right. \"Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.\" \"But,\" said Hermione, \"doesn't P stand for . . .\" \" &lsquo;Poor,' yeah,\" said Lee Jordan. \"Still, better than D, isn't it? &lsquo;Dreadful'?\" Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades. \"So top grade's O for &lsquo;Outstanding,' \" she was saying, \"and then there's A —\" \"No, E,\" George corrected her, \"E for &lsquo;Exceeds Expectations.' And I've always thought Fred and I should've got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.\" They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, \"So after E, it's A for &lsquo;Acceptable,' and that's the last pass grade, isn't it?\"THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR \"Yep,\" said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth, and swallowing it whole. \"Then you get P for &lsquo;Poor' \" — Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration — \"and D for &lsquo;Dreadful.' \" \"And then T,\" George reminded him. \"T?\" asked Hermione, looking appalled. \"Even lower than a D? What on earth does that stand for?\" \" &lsquo;Troll,' \" said George promptly. Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received T's in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on. \"You lot had an inspected lesson yet?\" Fred asked them. \"No,\" said Hermione at once, \"have you?\" \"Just now, before lunch,\" said George. \"Charms.\" \"What was it like?\" Harry and Hermione asked together. Fred shrugged. \"Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard. You know what Flitwick's like, he treated her like a guest, didn't seem to bother him at all. She didn't say much. Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it.\" \"I can't see old Flitwick getting marked down,\" said George, \"he usually gets everyone through their exams all right.\" \"Who've you got this afternoon?\" Fred asked Harry. \"Trelawney —\" \"A T if ever I saw one —\" \"— and Umbridge herself.\" \"Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,\" said George. \"Angelina'll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.\" But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out Dream Oracles, look round. \"Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,\" said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile. \"You received my note, I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?\" Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney's seat. She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin. Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses. \"We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,\" she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly. \"Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each other's latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.\" She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Um-bridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati's most recent dream. Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney's wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book.THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR \"Think of a dream, quick,\" he told Ron, \"in case the old toad comes our way.\" \"I did it last time,\" Ron protested, \"it's your turn, you tell me one.\" \"Oh, I dunno . . .\" said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. \"Let's say I dreamed I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that'll do. . . .\" Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle. \"Okay, we've got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject . . . would that be &lsquo;drowning' or &lsquo;cauldron' or &lsquo;Snape'?\" \"It doesn't matter, pick any of them,\" said Harry, chancing a glance behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney's shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary. \"What night did you dream this again?\" Ron said, immersed in calculations. \"I dunno, last night, whenever you like,\" Harry told him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out. \"Now,\" said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, \"you've been in this post how long, exactly?\" Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, \"Nearly sixteen years.\" \"Quite a period,\" said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. \"So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?\" \"That's right,\" said Professor Trelawney shortly. Professor Umbridge made another note. \"And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?\" \"Yes,\" said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher. Another note on the clipboard. \"But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?\" \"These things often skip — er — three generations,\" said Professor Trelawney. Professor Umbridge's toadlike smile widened. \"Of course,\" she said sweetly, making yet another note. \"Well, if you could just predict something for me, then?\" She looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Professor Trelawney had stiffened as though unable to believe her ears. \"I don't understand you,\" said Professor Trelawney, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck. \"I'd like you to make a prediction for me,\" said Professor Umbridge very clearly. Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height, her beads and bangles clinking. \"The Inner Eye does not See upon command!\" she said in scandalized tones. \"I see,\" said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her clipboard. \"I — but — but . . . wait!\" said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. \"I . . . I think I do see something . . . something that concerns you. . . . Why, I sense something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril . . .\"THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Um-bridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised. \"I am afraid . . . I am afraid that you are in grave danger!\" Professor Trelawney finished dramatically. There was a pause. Professor Umbridge's eyebrows were still raised. \"Right,\" she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more. \"Well, if that's really the best you can do . . .\" She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron's eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: They both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney's side — until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that was. \"Well?\" she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry's nose, uncharacteristically brisk. \"Let me see the start you've made on your dream diary, please.\" And by the time she had interpreted Harry's dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic toward her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later. She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell. \"Wands away,\" she instructed them all smilingly, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags. \"As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, &lsquo;Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation.' There will be no need to talk.\" Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year's lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again. Professor Umbridge had noticed too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione, she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, \"What is it this time, Miss Granger?\" \"I've already read chapter two,\" said Hermione. \"Well then, proceed to chapter three.\" \"I've read that too. I've read the whole book.\" Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly. \"Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen.\" \"He says that counterjinxes are improperly named,\" said Hermione promptly. \"He says &lsquo;counterjinx' is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.\" Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows, and Harry knew she was impressed against her will. \"But I disagree,\" Hermione continued. Professor Umbridge's eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder.THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR \"You disagree?\" \"Yes, I do,\" said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the class's attention. \"Mr. Slinkhard doesn't like jinxes, does he? But I think they can be very useful when they're used defensively.\" \"Oh, you do, do you?\" said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. \"Well, I'm afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard's opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.\" \"But —\" Hermione began. \"That is enough,\" said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. \"Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House.\" There was an outbreak of muttering at this. \"What for?\" said Harry angrily. \"Don't you get involved!\" Hermione whispered urgently to him. \"For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,\" said Professor Umbridge smoothly. \"I am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but as none of them — with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects — would have passed a Ministry inspection —\" \"Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,\" said Harry loudly, \"there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.\" This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then — \"I think another week's detentions would do you some good, Mr. Potter,\" said Umbridge sleekly. The cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and by the following morning, it was bleeding again. He did not complain during the evening's detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter. The very worst part of this second week's worth of detentions was, just as George had predicted, Angelina's reaction. She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table. \"Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But Professor — he's gone and landed himself in detention again —\" \"What's this, Potter?\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry. \"Detention? From whom?\" \"From Professor Umbridge,\" muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall's beady, square-framed eyes. \"Are you telling me,\" she said, lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, \"that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge's class again?\" \"Yes,\" Harry muttered, speaking to the floor. \"Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for serious trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But — what? Professor, no!\" Harry said, furious at this injustice. \"I'm already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well?\" \"Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you what-THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR soever!\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. \"No, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy!\" She strode back toward the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which Harry flung himself onto the bench beside Ron, fuming. \"She's taken points off Gryffindor because I'm having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?\" \"I know, mate,\" said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto Harry's plate, \"she's bang out of order.\" Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing. \"You think McGonagall was right, do you?\" said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione's face. \"I wish she hadn't taken points from you, but I think she's right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,\" said Hermione's voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech. Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger; Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head. \"Excellent,\" whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. \"Let's see Umbridge get what she deserves.\" Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there. \"That will do,\" she said and silence fell immediately. \"Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown, please take this box of mice — don't be silly, girl, they won't hurt you — and hand one to each student —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back Harry's essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A. \"Right then, everyone, listen closely — Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention — most of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell. Today we shall be —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Professor Umbridge. \"Yes?\" said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line. \"I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec —\" \"Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,\" said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks of glee. \"As I was saying, today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell —\" \"Hem, hem.\" \"I wonder,\" said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, \"how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.\" Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more. \"As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal,THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So — you know the incantation, let me see what you can do. . . .\" \"How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge!\" Harry said to Ron under his voice, but he was grinning; his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated. Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought that Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however, take many more notes while she sat in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim expression on her face. \"Well, it's a start,\" said Ron, holding up a long, wriggling mouse tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around. As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teacher's desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop. \"How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\" Professor Um-bridge asked. \"Thirty-nine years this December,\" said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut. Professor Umbridge made a note. \"Very well,\" she said, \"you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days' time.\" \"I can hardly wait,\" said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off toward the door. \"Hurry up, you three,\" she added, sweeping Harry, Ron, and Hermione before her. Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return. He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong. When they walked down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"You do not usually take this class, is that correct?\" Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living twigs. \"Quite correct,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet. \"I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.\" Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry. \"Hmm,\" said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly, \"I wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid's very extended leave of absence?\" Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly. \" 'Fraid I can't,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. \"Don't know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks teaching work, accepted — that's as much as I know. Well . . . shall I get started then?\" \"Yes, please do,\" said Professor Umbridge, scribbling upon her clipboard. Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among the students, questioning them on magical creatures. Most people were able to answer well and Harry's spirits lifted somewhat; at least the class was not letting Hagrid down. \"Overall,\" said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor GrubblyPlank's side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, \"how do you, as a temporary member of staff — an objective outsider, I suppose THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR you might say — how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management?\" \"Oh, yes, Dumbledore's excellent,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily. \"No, I'm very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.\" Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on, \"And what are you planning to cover with this class this year — assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return?\" \"Oh, I'll take them through the creatures that most often come up in O.W.L.,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"Not much left to do — they've studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we'd cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know. . . .\" \"Well, you seem to know what you're doing, at any rate,\" said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis she put on \"you\" and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle: \"Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class?\" Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question. \"That was me,\" he said. \"I was slashed by a hippogriff.\" \"A hippogriff?\" said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically. \"Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,\" said Harry angrily. Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harry's direction. \"Another night's detention, I think,\" she said softly. \"Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that's all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.\" \"Jolly good,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Um-bridge set off back across the lawn to the castle. It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge's office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical. \"Here,\" she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward him, \"soak your hand in that, it's a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.\" Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down. \"Thanks,\" he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks's ears with his left hand. \"I still reckon you should complain about this,\" said Ron in a low voice. \"No,\" said Harry flatly. \"McGonagall would go nuts if she knew —\" \"Yeah, she probably would,\" said Harry. \"And how long d'you reckon it'd take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?\" Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way. \"She's an awful woman,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \"Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we've got to do something about her.\" \"I suggested poison,\" said Ron grimly. \"No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any defense from her at all,\" said Hermione.THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR \"Well, what can we do about that?\" said Ron, yawning. \" 'S too late, isn't it? She got the job, she's here to stay, Fudge'll make sure of that.\" \"Well,\" said Hermione tentatively. \"You know, I was thinking today. . . .\" She shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, \"I was thinking that — maybe the time's come when we should just — just do it ourselves.\" \"Do what ourselves?\" said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles. \"Well — learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves,\" said Hermione. \"Come off it,\" groaned Ron. \"You want us to do extra work? D'you realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week?\" \"But this is much more important than homework!\" said Hermione. Harry and Ron goggled at her. \"I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework,\" said Ron. \"Don't be silly, of course there is!\" said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in her. \"It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting out there. It's about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don't learn anything for a whole year —\" \"We can't do much by ourselves,\" said Ron in a defeated voice. \"I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose —\" \"No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,\" said Hermione. \"We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we're going wrong.\" \"If you're talking about Lupin . . .\" Harry began. \"No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,\" said Hermione. \"He's too busy with the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that's not nearly often enough.\" \"Who, then?\" said Harry, frowning at her. Hermione heaved a very deep sigh. \"Isn't it obvious?\" she said. \"I'm talking about you, Harry.\" There was a moment's silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered. \"About me what?\" said Harry. \"I'm talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.\" Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry's consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated. He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, \"That's an idea.\" \"What's an idea?\" said Harry. \"You,\" said Ron. \"Teaching us to do it.\" \"But . . .\" Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg. \"But I'm not a teacher, I can't —\" \"Harry, you're the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione. \"Me?\" said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. \"No I'm not, you've beaten me in every test —\" \"Actually, I haven't,\" said Hermione coolly. \"You beat me in our third year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I'm not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you've done!\" \"How d'you mean?\" \"You know what, I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,\" Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. \"Let's think,\" he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. \"Uh . . . first year — you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.\"THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR \"But that was luck,\" said Harry, \"that wasn't skill —\" \"Second year,\" Ron interrupted, \"you killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle.\" \"Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up I —\" \"Third year,\" said Ron, louder still, \"you fought off about a hundred dementors at once —\" \"You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't —\" \"Last year,\" Ron said, almost shouting now, \"you fought off YouKnow-Who again —\" \"Listen to me!\" said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. \"Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck — I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I didn't plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help —\" Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn't even sure why he was feeling so angry. \"Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn't I?\" he said heatedly. \"I know what went on, all right? And I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because — because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right — but I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing — STOP LAUGHING!\" The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn't remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and Hermione's smiles had vanished. \"You don't know what it's like! You — neither of you — you've never had to face him, have you? You think it's just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you're in class or something? The whole time you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own — your own brain or guts or whatever — like you can think straight when you know you're about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die — they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that — and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up — you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me —\" \"We weren't saying anything like that, mate,\" said Ron, looking aghast. \"We weren't having a go at Diggory, we didn't — you've got the wrong end of the —\" He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken. \"Harry,\" she said timidly, \"don't you see? This . . . this is exactly why we need you. . . . We need to know what it's r-really like . . . facing him . . . facing V-Voldemort.\" It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort's name, and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry. Still breathing hard, he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence. \"Well . . . think about it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"Please?\" Harry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed of his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was agreeing to. Hermione stood up. \"Well, I'm off to bed,\" she said in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it. \"Erm . . . 'night.\" Ron had gotten to his feet too. \"Coming?\" he said awkwardly to Harry. \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"In . . . in a minute. I'll just clear this up.\" He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left. \"Reparo,\" Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken piecesTHE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR of china. They flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl. He was suddenly so tired that he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead he got to his feet and followed Ron upstairs. His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors, and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again.\n",

      "In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented self-stirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest. \"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\" Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. CHAPTER SIXTEEN \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.\" Harry was rubbing his forehead. \"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting — it's happened before, but never as often as this.\" \"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested. \"I'm not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it's a warning . . . it means danger's coming. . . .\" Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot. \"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quid-ditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\" Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.\" Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Ha-grid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy . . . never . . . but — Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. \"Where're you going?\" said Ron sleepily. \"I've just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white. \"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.\" \"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?\" \"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. \"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\" \"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off. \"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\" \"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\" He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. \"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head — that's one o' the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\" Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. CHAPTER SIXTEEN \"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\" \"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \"Yeah . . . he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here. . . . He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after . . . so I told him . . . an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon . . . an' then . . . I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks. . . . Let's see . . . yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home. . . . So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. . . .\" \"And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. \"Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep —\" Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. \"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey — where're yeh goin'?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. \"We've got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must've been easy, once he'd got Ha-grid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him. Where's Dumbledore's office?\" They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. \"We'll just have to —\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. \"What are you three doing inside?\" It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. \"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. \"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\" Harry swallowed — now what? \"It's sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared. \"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\" \"He's gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\" \"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time —\" \"But this is important.\" \"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\" \"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor — it's about the Sorcerer's Stone —\" Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up. CHAPTER SIXTEEN \"How do you know — ?\" she spluttered. \"Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone's going to try and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\" She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. \"I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected.\" \"But Professor —\" \"Potter, I know what I'm talking about,\" she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. \"I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\" But they didn't. \"It's tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \"Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\" \"But what can we —\" Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. Snape was standing there. \"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly. They stared at him. \"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile. \"We were —\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. \"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around  like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?\" Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. \"Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\" He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \"Right, here's what we've got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that.\" \"Why me?\" \"It's obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \" &lsquo;Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . .'\" \"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. \"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron. \"Come on.\" But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. \"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own House!\" CHAPTER SIXTEEN Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione's on Snape's tail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. \"I'm sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went.\" \"Well, that's it then, isn't it?\" Harry said. The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. \"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first.\" \"You're mad!\" said Ron. \"You can't!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You'll be expelled!\" \"SO WHAT?\" Harry shouted. \"Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\" He glared at them. \"You're right, Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \"I'll use the Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lucky I got it back.\" \"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron. \"All — all three of us?\" \"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go and look through my books, there might be something useful. . . .\" \"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\" \"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not throwing me out after that.\" After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Ha-grid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn't feel much like singing. He ran back down to the common room. CHAPTER SIXTEEN \"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —\" \"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom. \"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. Neville stared at their guilty faces. \"You're going out again,\" he said. \"No, no, no,\" said Hermione. \"No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?\" Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. \"You can't go out,\" said Neville, \"you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\" \"You don't understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\" But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. \"I won't let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \"I'll — I'll fight you!\" \"Neville,\" Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don't be an idiot —\" \"Don't you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. \"I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\" \"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don't know what you're doing.\" He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. \"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I'm ready!\" Harry turned to Hermione. \"Do something,\" he said desperately. Hermione stepped forward. \"Neville,\" she said, \"I'm really, really sorry about this.\" She raised her wand. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. \"What've you done to him?\" Harry whispered. \"It's the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry.\" \"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry. \"You'll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. CHAPTER SIXTEEN At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. \"Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything. They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. \"Who's there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \"Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\" He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. \"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.\" Harry had a sudden idea. \"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\" Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. \"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,\" he said greasily. \"My mistake, my mistake — I didn't see you — of course I didn't, you're invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\" \"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this place tonight.\" \"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.\" And he scooted off. \"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron. A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar. \"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape's already got past Fluffy.\" Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. \"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the cloak, I won't need it now.\" \"Don't be stupid,\" said Ron. \"We're coming,\" said Hermione. Harry pushed the door open. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them. \"What's that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered. \"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\" \"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes . . .\" He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. \"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. CHAPTER SIXTEEN \"I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog's back. \"Want to go first, Hermione?\" \"No, I don't!\" \"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. \"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously. \"Nothing — just black — there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop.\" Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. \"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\" Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\" \"Right,\" said Ron. \"See you in a minute, I hope. . . .\" And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and — FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on  something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. \"It's okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it's a soft landing, you can jump!\" Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. \"What's this stuff?\" were his first words. \"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\" The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side. \"We must be miles under the school,\" she said. \"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\" said Ron. \"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\" She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. \"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is — it's Devil's Snare!\" \"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. CHAPTER SIXTEEN \"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione. \"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp —\" \"So light a fire!\" Harry choked. \"Yes — of course — but there's no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. \"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\" \"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. \"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis — &lsquo;there's no wood,' honestly.\" \"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough . . . \"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered. Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. \"Do you think it's a ghost?\" \"I don't know . . . sounds like wings to me.\" \"There's light ahead — I can see something moving.\" They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. \"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron. \"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . well, there's no other choice . . . I'll run.\" He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm. \"Now what?\" said Ron. \"These birds . . . they can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering? \"They're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They're keys! Winged keys — look carefully. So that must mean . . .\" he looked around CHAPTER SIXTEEN the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \". . . yes — look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\" \"But there are hundreds of them!\" Ron examined the lock on the door. \"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the handle.\" They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. \"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\" Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. \"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down — and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\" Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against  the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber. They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned — it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. \"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. \"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered. \"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across the room.\" Behind the white pieces they could see another door. \"How?\" said Hermione nervously. \"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\" He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. \"Do we — er — have to join you to get across?\" CHAPTER SIXTEEN The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. \"This needs thinking about. . . .\" he said. \"I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces. . . .\" Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess —\" \"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\" \"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.\" \"What about you?\" \"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Ron. The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. \"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board. \"Yes . . . look . . .\" A white pawn had moved forward two squares. Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost? \"Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.\" Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. \"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\" Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. \"We're nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think — let me think . . .\" The white queen turned her blank face toward him. \"Yes . . .\" said Ron softly, \"it's the only way . . . I've got to be taken.\" \"NO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted. \"That's chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You've got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and she'll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\" \"But —\" \"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\" \"Ron —\" \"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\" There was no alternative. \"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go — now, don't hang around once you've won.\" He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. CHAPTER SIXTEEN The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. \"What if he's — ?\" \"He'll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do you reckon's next?\" \"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's . . .\" They had reached another door. \"All right?\" Harry whispered. \"Go on.\" Harry pushed it open. A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. \"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can't breathe.\" He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next — but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. \"Snape's,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\" They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped. \"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing. \"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn't magic — it's logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.\" \"But so will we, won't we?\" CHAPTER SIXTEEN \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\" \"But how do we know which to drink?\" \"Give me a minute.\" Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands. \"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire — toward the Stone.\" Harry looked at the tiny bottle. \"There's only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That's hardly one swallow.\" They looked at each other. \"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\" Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. \"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really.\" \"But Harry — what if You-Know-Who's with him?\" \"Well — I was lucky once, wasn't I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar. \"I might get lucky again.\" Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him. \"Hermione!\" \"Harry — you're a great wizard, you know.\" \"I'm not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. \"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!\" \"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren't you?\" \"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \"It's not poison?\" said Harry anxiously. \"No — but it's like ice.\" \"Quick, go, before it wears off.\" \"Good luck — take care —\" \"GO!\" Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire. Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. \"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other side, in the last chamber. There was already someone there — but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort.\n",

      "Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand. \"What do you think?\" asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking Harry's opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic. \"They brought the kids from the orphanage here?\" asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip. \"Not here, precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphansCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don't you?\" Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps. \"But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on. Come.\" Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face. \"Lumos,\" said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. \"You see?\" said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling. \"You will not object to getting a little wet?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and let us take the plunge.\" And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed. The water was icy; Harry's waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore's wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore's wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock. Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air. Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling. \"Yes, this is the place,\" said Dumbledore. \"How can you tell?\" Harry spoke in a whisper. \"It has known magic,\" said Dumbledore simply. Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness ofCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see. \"This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,\" said Dumbledore after a moment or two. \"We need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldemort's obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made. . . .\" Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall. \"Here,\" he said. \"We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.\" Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack. \"You've d-done it!\" said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around. \"Harry, I'm so sorry, I forgot,\" he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once, Harry's clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire. \"Thank you,\" said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledore's concentration. Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly, \"Oh, surely not. So crude.\" \"What is it, Professor?\" \"I rather think,\" said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, \"that we are required to make payment to pass.\" \"Payment?\" said Harry. \"You've got to give the door something?\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Blood, if I am not much mistaken.\" \"Blood?\" \"I said it was crude,\" said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of the standards Dumbledore expected. \"The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.\" \"Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . .\" said Harry, who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more. \"Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,\" said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand. \"Professor!\" protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife. \"I'll do it, I'm —\" He did not know what he was going to say — younger, fitter?CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening drops. \"You are very kind, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy's wounds. \"But your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn't it?\" The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not fade away: The blood-spattered rock within it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness. \"After me, I think,\" said Dumbledore, and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went. An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness. \"Let us walk,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Be very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me.\" He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving. \"Professor?\" he said finally. \"Do you think the Horcrux is here?\" \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes, I'm sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?\" \"We couldn't . . . we couldn't just try a Summoning Charm?\" Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible. \"Certainly we could,\" said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. \"Why don't you do it?\" \"Me? Oh . . . okay . . .\" Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, \"Accio Horcrux!\" With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore. \"What was that?\" \"Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.\" Harry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry's heart, however, was still pounding. \"Did you think that would happen, sir?\"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX \"I thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.\" \"But we don't know what the thing was,\" said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water. \"What the things are, you mean,\" said Dumbledore. \"I doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?\" \"Professor?\" \"Yes, Harry?\" \"Do you think we're going to have to go into the lake?\" \"Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.\" \"You don't think the Horcrux is at the bottom?\" \"Oh no . . . I think the Horcrux is in the middle.\" And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake. \"So we're going to have to cross the lake to get to it?\" \"Yes, I think so.\" Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water monsters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . . \"Aha,\" said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore's uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. \"So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.\" Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but through the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip something invisible. \"Oho,\" said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore's buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point. Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore's clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood. \"How did you know that was there?\" Harry asked in astonishment. \"Magic always leaves traces,\" said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, \"sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.\" \"Is . . . is this boat safe?\" \"Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.\" \"So the things in the water won't do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort's boat?\"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX \"I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.\" \"But why have they let us?\" asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank. \"Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he is right.\" Harry looked down into the boat. It really was very small. \"It doesn't look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?\" Dumbledore chuckled. \"Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.\" \"But then — ?\" \"I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.\" These words did nothing to raise Harry's morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, \"Voldemort's mistake, Harry, Voldemort's mistake . . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.\" Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boat's prow cleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves. Harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. . . . And then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface. \"Professor!\" he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water. \"Harry?\" \"I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand!\" \"Yes, I am sure you did,\" said Dumbledore calmly. Harry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat. \"So that thing that jumped out of the water — ?\" But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his openCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke. \"There are bodies in here!\" said Harry, and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own. \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore placidly, \"but we do not need to worry about them at the moment.\" \"At the moment?\" Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore. \"Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous. \"But one of them jumped,\" he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore's. \"When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,\" Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to Harry's bewildered expression. \"Oh . . . right . . .\" said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with the dead . . . It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. . . . He suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them . . . and he hadn't seen Ginny at all. . . . \"Nearly there,\" said Dumbledore cheerfully. Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. \"Careful not to touch the water,\" said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat. The island was no larger than Dumbledore's office, an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal. Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that phosphorescent glow. \"What is it?\" asked Harry quietly. \"I am not sure,\" said Dumbledore. \"Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.\" Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion. \"Sir, no, don't touch — !\"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX \"I cannot touch,\" said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. \"See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.\" Staring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and inflexible air. \"Out of the way, please, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again. \"You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?\" \"Oh yes.\" Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. \"But how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature.\" Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. \"I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.\" \"What?\" said Harry. \"No!\" \"Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths.\" \"But what if — what if it kills you?\" \"Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,\" said Dumbledore easily. \"Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.\" Harry couldn't believe it. Was this more of Dumbledore's insane determination to see good in everyone? \"Sir,\" said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, \"sir, this is Voldemort we're —\" \"I'm sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island,\" Dumbledore corrected himself. \"He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.\" Harry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard. \"Undoubtedly,\" he said, finally, \"this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am distracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You understand?\" Their eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was this why he had been invited along — so that he could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain? \"You remember,\" said Dumbledore, \"the condition on which I brought you with me?\"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX Harry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin. \"But what if — ?\" \"You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?\" \"Yes, but —\" \"I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but —\" \"Well, then,\" said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, \"you have my orders.\" \"Why can't I drink the potion instead?\" asked Harry desperately. \"Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,\" said Dumbledore. \"Once and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?\" \"Couldn't — ?\" \"Do I have it?\" \"But —\" \"Your word, Harry.\" \"I — all right, but —\" Before Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth. \"Your good health, Harry.\" And he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb. \"Professor?\" he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass. \"How do you feel?\" Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more. In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion. Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he staggered and fell forward against the basin. His eyes were still closed, his breathing heavy. \"Professor Dumbledore?\" said Harry, his voice strained. \"Can you hear me?\" Dumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream. His grip on the goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from it. Harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it steady. \"Professor, can you hear me?\" he repeated loudly, his voice echoing around the cavern. Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognize, for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this. \"I don't want . . . Don't make me . . .\" Harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what to do. \". . . don't like . . . want to stop . . .\" moaned Dumbledore. \"You . . . you can't stop, Professor,\" said Harry. \"You've got to keep drinking, remember? You told me you had to keep drinking. Here . . .\" Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced the goblet back toward Dumbledore's mouth and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside. \"No . . .\" he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back into theCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX basin and refilled it for him. \"I don't want to. . . . I don't want to. . . . Let me go. . . .\" \"It's all right, Professor,\" said Harry, his hand shaking. \"It's all right, I'm here —\" \"Make it stop, make it stop,\" moaned Dumbledore. \"Yes . . . yes, this'll make it stop,\" lied Harry. He tipped the contents of the goblet into Dumbledore's open mouth. Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast chamber, across the dead black water. \"No, no, no, no, I can't, I can't, don't make me, I don't want to. . . .\" \"It's all right, Professor, it's all right!\" said Harry loudly, his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion; the basin was now half empty. \"Nothing's happening to you, you're safe, it isn't real, I swear it isn't real — take this, now, take this. . . .\" And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was an antidote Harry offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably. \"It's all my fault, all my fault,\" he sobbed. \"Please make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and I'll never, never again . . .\" \"This will make it stop, Professor,\" Harry said, his voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into Dumbledore's mouth. Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him; his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from Harry's trembling hands as he moaned, \"Don't hurt them, don't hurt them, please, please, it's my fault, hurt me instead . . .\" \"Here, drink this, drink this, you'll be all right,\" said Harry desperately, and once again Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot. And now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering his fists upon the ground, while Harry filled the ninth goblet. \"Please, please, please, no . . . not that, not that, I'll do anything . . .\" \"Just drink, Professor, just drink . . .\" Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had finished, he yelled again as though his insides were on fire. \"No more, please, no more . . .\" Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin. \"We're nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. . . .\" He supported Dumbledore's shoulders and again, Dumbledore drained the glass; then Harry was on his feet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever, \"I want to die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want to die!\" \"Drink this, Professor. Drink this. . . .\" Dumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished than he yelled, \"KILL ME!\" \"This — this one will!\" gasped Harry. \"Just drink this . . . It'll be over . . . all over!\" Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face. \"No!\" shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself downCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX beside Dumbledore, and heaved him over onto his back; Dumbledore's glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. \"No,\" said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, \"no, you're not dead, you said it wasn't poison, wake up, wake up — Rennervate!\" he cried, his wand pointing at Dumbledore's chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened. \"Rennervate — sir — please —\" Dumbledore's eyelids flickered; Harry's heart leapt. \"Sir, are you — ?\" \"Water,\" croaked Dumbledore. \"Water,\" panted Harry. \"Yes —\" He leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin; he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it. \"Aguamenti!\" he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand. The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips — but it was empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant. \"But I had some — wait — Aguamenti!\" said Harry again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledore's mouth, the water vanished again. \"Sir, I'm trying, I'm trying!\" said Harry desperately, but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. \"Aguamenti — Aguamenti — AGUAMENTI !\" The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore's breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so . . . He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish. \"Sir — here!\" Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledore's face. It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him, slowly, backward across the rock. The surface of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the black water. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm: It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Harry bellowed again, backing away as he swiped his wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward him. \"Impedimenta! Incarcerous!\" A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, \"Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!\" But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, theirCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, and he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemort's shattered soul. . . . But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his arms, but scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around. Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth. The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to escape the fire in which they were enclosed. . . . Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the water's edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters. Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface. \"Sir,\" panted Harry, \"sir, I forgot — about fire — they were coming at me and I panicked —\" \"Quite understandable,\" murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was. They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall. \"I am weak. . . .\" he said. \"Don't worry, sir,\" said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledore's extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. \"Don't worry, I'll get us back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . .\" And pulling Dumbledore's uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight. \"The protection was . . . after all . . . well-designed,\" said Dumbledore faintly. \"One alone could not have done it. . . . You did well, very well, Harry. . . .\"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX \"Don't talk now,\" said Harry, fearing how slurred Dumbledore's voice had become, how much his feet dragged. \"Save your energy, sir. . . . We'll soon be out of here. . . .\" \"The archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife . . .\" \"There's no need, I got cut on the rock,\" said Harry firmly. \"Just tell me where. . . .\" \"Here . . .\" Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having received its tribute of blood, the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff. \"It's going to be all right, sir,\" Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledore's silence than he had been by his weakened voice. \"We're nearly there. . . . I can Apparate us both back. . . . Don't worry. . . .\" \"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am with you.\"\n",

      "Harry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it before, he had been here before: This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore's Pensieve, the place where he had watched the Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty benches rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell. A cold male voice rang across the courtroom. \"You're late.\" \"Sorry,\" said Harry nervously. \"I-I didn't know the time had changed.\" \"That is not the Wizengamot's fault,\" said the voice. \"An owl was sent to you this morning. Take your seat.\" Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room, the arms of which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked rather threateningly but did not bind him. Feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the bench above. There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing plum-colored robes with an elaborately worked silver W on the left-hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity. In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair sat on Fudge's left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudge's right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow. \"Very well,\" said Fudge. \"The accused being present — finally — let us begin. Are you ready?\" he called down the row. \"Yes, sir,\" said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron's brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy's eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand. \"Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,\" said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, \"into offenses committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. \"Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley —\" \"— Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,\" said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck. Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose. The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in welcome. A powerful emotion had risen in Harry's chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore's eye, but Dumbledore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge. \"Ah,\" said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. \"Dumbledore. Yes. You — er — got our — er — message that the time and — er — place of the hearing had been changed, then?\" \"I must have missed it,\" said Dumbledore cheerfully. \"However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.\" \"Yes — well — I suppose we'll need another chair — I — Weasley, could you — ?\" \"Not to worry, not to worry,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle down. \"Yes,\" said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. \"Well, then. So. The charges. Yes.\" He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took a deep breath, and read, \"The charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on August the second at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offense under paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thirteen of the International Confederation of Wizards' Statute of Secrecy. \"You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?\" Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his parchment. \"Yes,\" Harry said. \"You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did you not?\" \"Yes, but —\" \"And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August?\" said Fudge. \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but —\" \"Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen?\" \"Yes, but —\" \"Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?\" \"Yes, but —\" \"Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time? \"Yes,\" said Harry angrily, \"but I only used it because we were —\" The witch with the monocle on Fudge's left cut across him in a booming voice. \"You produced a fully fledged Patronus?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"because —\" \"A corporeal Patronus?\" \"A — what?\" said Harry. \"Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more than vapor or smoke?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, \"it's a stag, it's always a stag.\" \"Always?\" boomed Madam Bones. \"You have produced a Patronus before now?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"I've been doing it for over a year —\" \"And you are fifteen years old?\" \"Yes, and —\" \"You learned this at school?\" \"Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —\" \"Impressive,\" said Madam Bones, staring down at him, \"a true Patronus at that age . . . very impressive indeed.\" Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads. \"It's not a question of how impressive the magic was,\" said Fudge in a testy voice. \"In fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!\" Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but it was the sight of Percy's sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into speech. \"I did it because of the dementors!\" he said loudly, before anyone could interrupt him again. He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before. \"Dementors?\" said Madam Bones after a moment, raising her thick eyebrows so that her monocle looked in danger of falling out. \"What do you mean, boy?\" \"I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin!\" \"Ah,\" said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. \"Yes. Yes, I thought we'd be hearing something like this.\" \"Dementors in Little Whinging?\" Madam Bones said in tones of great surprise. \"I don't understand —\" \"Don't you, Amelia?\" said Fudge, still smirking. \"Let me explain. He's been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can't see dementors, can they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient . . . so it's just your word and no witnesses. . . .\" \"I'm not lying!\" said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of muttering from the court. \"There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it —\" \"Enough, enough!\" said Fudge with a very supercilious look on his face. \"I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story —\" Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again. \"We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway,\" he said, \"other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.\" Fudge's plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, \"We haven't got time to listen to more taradiddles, I'm afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly —\" \"I may be wrong,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly, \"but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to  present witnesses for his or her case? Isn't that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?\" he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle. \"True,\" said Madam Bones. \"Perfectly true.\" \"Oh, very well, very well,\" snapped Fudge. \"Where is this person?\" \"I brought her with me,\" said Dumbledore. \"She's just outside the door. Should I — ?\" \"No — Weasley, you go,\" Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, hurried down the stone steps from the judge's balcony, and hastened past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them. A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. Figg. She looked scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers. Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself. \"Full name?\" said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat. \"Arabella Doreen Figg,\" said Mrs. Figg in her quavery voice. \"And who exactly are you?\" said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice. \"I'm a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,\" said Mrs. Figg. \"We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging other than Harry Potter,\" said Madam Bones at once. \"That situation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.\" \"I'm a Squib,\" said Mrs. Figg. \"So you wouldn't have me registered, would you?\" \"A Squib, eh?\" said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. \"We'll be checking that. You'll leave details of your parentage with my assistant, Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?\" he added, looking left and right along the bench where he sat. \"Yes, we can!\" said Mrs. Figg indignantly. Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. \"Very well,\" he said coolly. \"What is your story?\" \"I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the evening of the second of August,\" gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, \"when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running —\" \"Running?\" said Madam Bones sharply. \"Dementors don't run, they glide.\" \"That's what I meant to say,\" said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. \"Gliding along the alley toward what looked like two boys.\" \"What did they look like?\" said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the monocle's edges disappeared into her flesh. \"Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny —\" \"No, no,\" said Madam Bones impatiently, \"the dementors . . . describe them.\" \"Oh,\" said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. \"They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.\" Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground, or the rotting smell of them, or that terrible, rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air . . . A dumpy wizard with a large black mustache in the second row leaned close to his neighbor, a frizzy-haired witch, and whispered something in her ear. She smirked and nodded. \"Big and wearing cloaks,\" repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. \"I see. Anything else?\" \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Figg. \"I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer's night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though all happiness had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . . dreadful things. . . .\" Her voice shook and died. Madam Bones' eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it. \"What did the dementors do?\" she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope. \"They went for the boys,\" said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. \"One of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced silver vapor. On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased away the second from his cousin. And that . . . that was what happened,\" Mrs. Figg finished, somewhat lamely. Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence; Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively \"That's what you saw, is it?\" \"That was what happened,\" Mrs. Figg repeated. \"Very well,\" said Fudge. \"You may go.\" Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off toward the door again. Harry heard it thud shut behind her. \"Not a very convincing witness,\" said Fudge loftily. \"Oh, I don't know,\" said Madam Bones in her booming voice. \"She certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately. And I can't imagine why she would say they were there if they weren't —\" \"But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard?\" snorted Fudge. \"The odds on that must be very, very long, even Bagman wouldn't have bet —\" \"Oh, I don't think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence,\" said Dumbledore lightly. The witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in shadow moved slightly, but everyone else was quite still and silent. \"And what is that supposed to mean?\" asked Fudge icily. \"It means that I think they were ordered there,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!\" barked Fudge. \"Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.\" \"Yes, you have,\" said Fudge forcefully, \"and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to.\" \"Then,\" said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, \"we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of August.\" In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forward so that Harry saw her for the first time. He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon, and a very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round, and slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue. \"The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,\" said Fudge. The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak. \"I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,\" she said with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. \"So silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!\" She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused. \"If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,\" said Dumbledore politely. \"Of course, these particular dementors may have been outside Ministry control —\" \"There are no dementors outside Ministry control!\" snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red. Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow. \"Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorization.\" \"It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore!\" snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would have been proud. \"Of course it isn't,\" said Dumbledore mildly. \"I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated.\" He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him, frowning slightly. \"I would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy's imagination, is not the subject of this hearing!\" said Fudge. \"We are here to examine Harry Potter's offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery!\" \"Of course we are,\" said Dumbledore, \"but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or Muggles present at the time of the —\" \"We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!\" snarled Fudge. \"Of course you are,\" said Dumbledore courteously. \"Then we are in agreement that Harry's use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes?\" \"If there were dementors, which I doubt —\" \"You have heard from an eyewitness,\" Dumbledore interrupted. \"If you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she would not object.\" \"I — that — not —\" blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him. \"It's — I want this over with today, Dumbledore!\" \"But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,\" said Dumbledore. \"Serious miscarriage, my hat!\" said Fudge at the top of his voice. \"Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you've forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years ago —\" \"That wasn't me, it was a house-elf!\" said Harry. \"YOU SEE?\" roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry's direction. \"A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you —\" \"The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,\" said Dumbledore. \"I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish.\" \"I — not — I haven't got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that's not the only — he blew up his aunt, for God's sake!\" Fudge shouted, banging his fist on the judge's bench and upsetting a bottle of ink. \"And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,\" said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes. \"And I haven't even started on what he gets up to at school —\" \"— but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school, Harry's behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry,\" said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words. \"Oho!\" said Fudge. \"Not our business what he does at school, eh? You think so?\" \"The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,\" said Dumbledore. \"Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.\" \"Laws can be changed,\" said Fudge savagely. \"Of course they can,\" said Dumbledore, inclining his head. \"And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!\" A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless. \"As far as I am aware, however,\" Dumbledore continued, \"there is no law yet in place that says this court's job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a specific offense and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do now is to await your verdict.\" Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more. Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry's attempt to catch his eye. He continued to look up at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, whispered conversations. Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had expected the hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that he had made a good impression. He had not really said very much. He ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed. . . . Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoes. Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining his laces. \"Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?\" said Madam Bones's booming voice. Harry's head jerked upward. There were hands in the air, many of them . . . more than half! Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but before he could finish Madam Bones had said, \"And those in favor of conviction?\" Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the witch on his right and the heavily mustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in the second row. Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He took two deep breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, \"Very well, very well . . . cleared of all charges.\" \"Excellent,\" said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling out his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. \"Well, I must be getting along. Good day to you all.\" And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon.\n",

      "The next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long House tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way she said \" 'Morning,\" which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met. \"Mail's due any minute — I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot.\" Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville's head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers. \"Errol!\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak. \"Oh, no —\" Ron gasped. \"It's all right, he's still alive,\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger. \"It's not that — it's that.\" Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode. \"What's the matter?\" said Harry. \"She's — she's sent me a Howler,\" said Ron faintly. \"You'd better open it, Ron,\" said Neville in a timid whisper. \"It'll be worse if you don't. My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\" — he gulped — \"it was horrible.\" Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope. \"What's a Howler?\" he said. But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners. \"Open it,\" Neville urged. \"It'll all be over in a few minutes —\" Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol's beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling. \"— STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE —\" Mrs. Weasley's yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen. \"— LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED —\" Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb. \"— ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED — YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.\" A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again. Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head. \"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you —\" \"Don't tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron. Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for him over the summer . . . But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first. Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again. As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor Sprout's arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings. Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming. \"Oh, hello there!\" he called, beaming around at the assembled  students. \"Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! But I don't want you running away with the idea that I'm better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels . . .\" \"Greenhouse three today, chaps!\" said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self. There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before — greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart's hand shot out. \"Harry! I've been wanting a word — you don't mind if he's a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\" Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, \"That's the ticket,\" and closed the greenhouse door in her face. \"Harry,\" said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head. \"Harry, Harry, Harry.\" Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing. \"When I heard — well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked myself.\" Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so when Lockhart went on, \"Don't know when I've been more shocked. Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you'd done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.\" It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn't talking. \"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn't I?\" said Lockhart. \"Gave you the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldn't wait to do it again.\" \"Oh, no, Professor, see —\" \"Harry, Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder. \"I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you've had that first taste — and I blame myself for giving you that, because it was bound to go to your head — but see here, young man, you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you're older. Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking! &lsquo;It's all right for him, he's an internationally famous wizard already!' But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, I'd say I was even more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven't they? All that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry's forehead. \"I know, I know — it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's MostCharming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have — but it's a start, Harry, it's a start.\" He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside. Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored earmuffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she said, \"We'll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?\" To nobody's surprise, Hermione's hand was first into the air. \"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\" said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. \"It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.\" \"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\" said Professor Sprout. \"The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\" Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again. \"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\" she said promptly. \"Precisely. Take another ten points,\" said Professor Sprout. \"Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.\" She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the \"cry\" of the Mandrake. \"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,\" said Professor Sprout. There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn't pink and fluffy. \"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,\" said Professor Sprout. \"When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. Right — earmuffs on.\" Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard. Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear. Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs. Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs. \"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet,\" she said calmly as though she'd just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. \"However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up. \"Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here — compost in the sacks over there — and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula, it's teething.\" She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to. \"Justin Finch-Fletchley,\" he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand. \"Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter. . . . And you're Hermione Granger — always top in everything\" (Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) \"— and Ron Weasley. Wasn't that your flying car?\" Ron didn't smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind. \"That Lockhart's something, isn't he?\" said Justin happily as they began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. \"Awfully brave chap. Have you read his books? I'd have died of fear if I'd been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and — zap — just fantastic. \"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she's begun to see how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family. . . .\" After that they didn't have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't. The Mandrakes didn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot. By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration. Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed  to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand. Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased. Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk. \"Stupid — useless — thing —\" \"Write home for another one,\" Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker. \"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\" said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag. \" &lsquo;It's your own fault your wand got snapped —' \" They went down to lunch, where Ron's mood was not improved by Hermione's showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in Transfiguration. \"What've we got this afternoon?\" said Harry, hastily changing the subject. \"Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione at once. \"Why,\" demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, \"have you outlined all Lockhart's lessons in little hearts?\" Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously. They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'd seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red. \"All right, Harry? I'm — I'm Colin Creevey,\" he said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. \"I'm in Gryffindor, too. D'you think — would it be all right if — can I have a picture?\" he said, raising the camera hopefully. \"A picture?\" Harry repeated blankly. \"So I can prove I've met you,\" said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging further forward. \"I know all about you. Everyone's told me. About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar on your forehead\" (his eyes raked Harry's hairline) \"and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'll move.\" Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, \"It's amazing here, isn't it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hog-warts. My dad's a milkman, he couldn't believe it either. So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home to him. And it'd be really good if I had one of you\" — he looked imploringly at Harry — \"maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?\" \"Signed photos? You're giving out signed photos, Potter?\" Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy's voice echoed around the courtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle. \"Everyone line up!\" Malfoy roared to the crowd. \"Harry Potter's giving out signed photos!\" \"No, I'm not,\" said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. \"Shut up, Malfoy.\" \"You're just jealous,\" piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe's neck. \"Jealous?\" said Malfoy, who didn't need to shout anymore: Half the courtyard was listening in. \"Of what? I don't want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. I don't think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.\" Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly. \"Eat slugs, Malfoy,\" said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way. \"Be careful, Weasley,\" sneered Malfoy. \"You don't want to start any trouble or your mommy'll have to come and take you away from school.\" He put on a shrill, piercing voice. \"If you put another toe out of line —\" A knot of Slytherin fifth years nearby laughed loudly at this. \"Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,\" smirked Malfoy. \"It'd be worth more than his family's whole house —\" Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, \"Look out!\" \"What's all this, what's all this?\" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. \"Who's giving out signed photos?\" Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, \"Shouldn't have asked! We meet again, Harry!\" Pinned to Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd. \"Come on then, Mr. Creevey,\" said Lockhart, beaming at Colin. \"A double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign it for you.\" Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes. \"Off you go, move along there,\" Lockhart called to the crowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side. \"A word to the wise, Harry,\" said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door. \"I covered up for you back there with young Creevey — if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up so much. . . .\" Deaf to Harry's stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase. \"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn't sensible — looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you'll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but\" — he gave a little chortle — \"I don't think you're quite there yet.\" They had reached Lockhart's classroom and he let Harry go at  last. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart's books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing. The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry. \"You could've fried an egg on your face,\" said Ron. \"You'd better hope Creevey doesn't meet Ginny, or they'll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.\" \"Shut up,\" snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase \"Harry Potter fan club.\" When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom's copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front. \"Me,\" he said, pointing at it and winking as well. \"Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award — but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!\" He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly. \"I see you've all bought a complete set of my books — well done. I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about — just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in —\" When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, \"You have thirty minutes — start — now!\" Harry looked down at his paper and read: 1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color? 2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition? 3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date? On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to: 54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday, and what would his ideal gift be? Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class. \"Tut, tut — hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully — I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples — though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhisky!\" He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name. \". . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions — good girl! In fact\" — he flipped her paper over — \"full marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger?\" &bull; 100 &#145;GILDEROY LOCKHART Hermione raised a trembling hand. \"Excellent!\" beamed Lockhart. \"Quite excellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so — to business —\" He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it. \"Now — be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.\" In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row seat. \"I must ask you not to scream,\" said Lockhart in a low voice. \"It might provoke them.\" As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover. \"Yes,\" he said dramatically. \"Freshly caught Cornish pixies.\" Seamus Finnigan couldn't control himself. He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror. \"Yes?\" He smiled at Seamus. \"Well, they're not — they're not very — dangerous, are they?\" Seamus choked. \"Don't be so sure!\" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. \"Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!\" The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they  had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them. \"Right, then,\" Lockhart said loudly. \"Let's see what you make of them!\" And he opened the cage. It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling. \"Come on now — round them up, round them up, they're only pixies,\" Lockhart shouted. He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed, \"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!\" It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way. The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\" He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him. \"Can you believe him?\" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear. \"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\" said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage. \"Hands on?\" said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. \"Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing —\" \"Rubbish,\" said Hermione. \"You've read his books — look at all those amazing things he's done —\" \"He says he's done,\" Ron muttered.\n",

      "Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat's, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh. Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them. \"My Lord . . .\" he choked, \"my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise . . .\" \"Hold out your arm,\" said Voldemort lazily. \"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master . . .\" He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again. \"The other arm, Wormtail.\" \"Master, please . . . please . . .\" Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo — a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth — the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping. \"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it . . . and now, we shall see . . . now we shall know . . .\" He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. The scar on Harry's forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard. \"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\" he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \"And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face. \"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\" he hissed softly. \"A Muggle and a fool . . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. . . .\" Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass. \"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. . . . He didn't like magic, my father . . . \"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born, Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him . . . I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\" Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. \"Listen to me, reliving family history . . .\" he said quietly, \"why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\" The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes. Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort, and kissed the hem of his black robes. \"Master . . . Master . . .\" he murmured. The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle's grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind, a rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered. \"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years . . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday. . . . We are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\" He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like nostrils widening. \"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench of guilt upon the air.\" A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare, to step back from him. \"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact — such prompt appearances! — and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\" No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. \"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must haveCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . . \"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living? \"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort . . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\" At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them. \"It is a disappointment to me . . . I confess myself disappointed. . . .\" One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet. \"Master!\" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\" Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . . . anything . . . Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. \"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years . . . I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\" He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob. \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please, Master . . . please . . .\" \"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers. . . .\" Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtail's bleeding wrist. Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. \"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master . . . it is beautiful . . . thank you . . . thank you. . . .\" He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort. \"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\" Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay . . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\" \"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me —\" \"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. . . . I expect more faithful service in the future.\" \"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. . . .\" Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space — large enough for two people — that separated Malfoy and the next man. \"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us . . . they are our natural allies . . . we will recall the banished giants . . . I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. . . .\" He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. \"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. . . .\" \"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair. \"And here\" — Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures — \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\" They bowed clumsily, muttering dully. \"Yes, Master . . .\" \"We will, Master. . . .\" \"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyle's shadow. \"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful —\" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort. He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there. \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return . . . he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever . . . he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. \"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . . \"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\" There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Worm-tail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. \"Master, we crave to know . . . we beg you to tell us . . . how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. . . .\" \"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins — and ends — with my young friend here.\" He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle. \"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him — and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. . . . I could not touch the boy.\" Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek. \"His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it . . . but no matter. I can touch him now.\" Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know . . . I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal — to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked . . . for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself . . . for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . . \"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. . . . I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me . . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . . but I waited in vain. . . .\" The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE I sometimes inhabited animals — snakes, of course, being my preference — but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . . \"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard — young, foolish, and gullible — wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of . . . for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school . . . he was easy to bend to my will . . . he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. . . .\" Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry. \"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\" Voldemort continued. \"I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour . . . I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. . . .\" One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice. \"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last . . . a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . . \"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic. \"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail — displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him — convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her . . . he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams . . . for — with a little persuasion — she became a veritable mine of information. \"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things . . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless. \"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth . . . a spell or two of my own invention . . . a little help from my dear Nagini,\" Voldemort's red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \"a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided . . . I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel. \"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower . . . I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength. \"I knew that to achieve this — it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight — I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . . \"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe . . . Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me . . . as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potter's blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . . . \"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. . . . I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggle-loving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him? \"Why . . . by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament — that he touched the Triwizard Cup first — the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is . . . the boy you all believed had been my downfall. . . .\" Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar;CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end . . . to black out . . . to die . . . And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter. \"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\" said Voldemort. \"But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\" he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching. \"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\"\n",

      "The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross. \"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid. \"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\" She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. \"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room. \"The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hog-warts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. \"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\" Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. \"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor Mc-Gonagall. \"Please wait quietly.\" She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \"How exactly do they sort us into Houses?\" he asked Ron. \"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\" Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed. \"What the — ?\" He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —\" \"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?\" A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. Nobody answered. \"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\" A few people nodded mutely. \"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old House, you know.\" \"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.\" Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. \"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\" Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \"It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\" It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens. Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house. Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, But don't judge on what you see, I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don't be afraid! And don't get in a flap! You're in safe hands (though I have none) For I'm a Thinking Cap!\" The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. \"So we've just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\" Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a  lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. \"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\" A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment's pause — \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat. The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. \"Bones, Susan!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \"Boot, Terry!\" \"RAVENCLAW!\" The table second from the left clapped this time; several Raven-claws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. \"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling. \"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. \"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. \"Granger, Hermione!\" Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned. A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\" Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\" Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. There weren't many people left now. \"Moon\" . . . , \"Nott\" . . . , \"Parkinson\" . . . , then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" . . . , then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" . . . , and then, at last — \"Potter, Harry!\" As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. \"Potter, did she say?\" \"The Harry Potter?\" The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. \"Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?\" Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. \"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you're sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the  Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. And now there were only four people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. \"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. \"Welcome!\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \"Thank you!\" He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. \"Is he — a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly. \"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\" Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. \"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. \"Can't you — ?\" \"I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\" \"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you — you're Nearly Headless Nick!\" \"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —\" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. \"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\" Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted. \"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So — new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable — he's the Slytherin ghost.\" Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements. \"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest. \"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as be- fore. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate &eacute;clairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding . . . As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. \"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\" The others laughed. \"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron. \"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\" On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult —\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —\"). Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead. \"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head. \"What is it?\" asked Percy. \"N-nothing.\" The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look — a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all. \"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy. \"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to — everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\" Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \"Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\" Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. \"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch. \"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\" Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \"He's not serious?\" he muttered to Percy. \"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere — the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\" \"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed. Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. \"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\" And the school bellowed: \"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they're bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot, Just do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.\" Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\" The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more  staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. \"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves — show yourself.\" A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. \"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\" There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\" He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy. Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\" At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. \"Great food, isn't it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets.\" Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.\n",

      "Harry remained kneeling at Snape's side, simply staring down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped to his feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room. Voldemort's voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away. \"You have fought,\" said the high, cold voice, \"valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery. \"Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. \"Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. \"I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.\" Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry. \"Don't listen to him,\" said Ron. \"It'll be all right,\" said Hermione wildly. \"Let's — let's get back to the castle, if he's gone to the forest we'll need to think of a new plan —\" She glanced at Snape's body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done. . . . They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads, as he could. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. . . . One hour. . . . Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. It could only be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone clog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker. The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters had been blown away. \"Where is everyone?\" whispered Hermione. Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in groups, their arms around each other's necks. The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred's body, because his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred's chest, her body shaking, Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks. Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron's shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling. The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the doorway. He could not drawCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died. . . . He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks . . . He yearned not to feel. . . . He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him. . . . The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape's last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster's office. \"Password?\" \"Dumbledore!\" said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase behind. But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle, so that they could have a clear view of what was going on. Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore's deserted frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster's chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape's memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else's head would be a blessed relief. . . . Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived. He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt. Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. \"Lily, don't do it!\" shrieked the elder of the two. But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly. \"Mummy told you not to!\" Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. \"Mummy said you weren't allowed, Lily!\" \"But I'm fine,\" said Lily, still giggling. \"Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.\" Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily hadCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster. \"Stop it!\" shrieked Petunia. \"It's not hurting you,\" said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground. \"It's not right,\" said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower's flight to the ground and lingered upon it. \"How do you do it?\" she added, and there was definite longing in her voice. \"It's obvious, isn't it?\" Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily. \"What's obvious?\" asked Lily. Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, \"I know what you are.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You're . . . you're a witch,\" whispered Snape. She looked affronted. \"That's not a very nice thing to say to somebody!\" She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. \"No!\" said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older self. The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag. \"You are,\" said Snape to Lily. \"You are a witch. I've been watching you for a while. But there's nothing wrong with that. My mum's one, and I'm a wizard.\" Petunia's laugh was like cold water. \"Wizard!\" she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance. \"I know who you are. You're that Snape boy! They live down Spinner's End by the river,\" she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. \"Why have you been spying on us?\" \"Haven't been spying,\" said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. \"Wouldn't spy on you, anyway,\" he added spitefully, \"you're a Muggle.\" Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone. \"Lily, come on, we're leaving!\" she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snape's bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong. . . . The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light. \". . . and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.\" \"But I have done magic outside school!\" \"We're all right. We haven't got wands yet. They let you off when you're a kid and you can't help it. But once you're eleven,\" he nodded importantly, \"and they start training you, then you've got to go careful.\" There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, \"It is real, isn't it? It's not a joke? Petunia says you're lying to me. Petunia says there isn't a Hogwarts. It is real, isn't it?\" \"It's real for us,\" said Snape. \"Not for her. But we'll get the letter, you and me.\" \"Really?\" whispered Lily. \"Definitely,\" said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny. \"And will it really come by owl?\" Lily whispered. \"Normally,\" said Snape. \"But you're Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.\" \"Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?\" Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair. \"No,\" he said. \"It doesn't make any difference.\" \"Good,\" said Lily, relaxing: It was clear that she had been worrying. \"You've got loads of magic,\" said Snape. \"I saw that. All the time I was watching you . . .\" His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground. \"How are things at your house?\" Lily asked. A little crease appeared between his eyes. \"Fine,\" he said. \"They're not arguing anymore?\" \"Oh yes, they're arguing,\" said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. \"But it won't be that long and I'll be gone.\" \"Doesn't your dad like magic?\" \"He doesn't like anything, much,\" said Snape. \"Severus?\" A little smile twisted Snape's mouth when she said his name. \"Yeah?\" \"Tell me about the dementors again.\" \"What d'you want to know about them for?\" \"If I use magic outside school —\" \"They wouldn't give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You're not going to end up in Azkaban, you're too —\" He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a smallCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing. \"Tuney!\" said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet. \"Who's spying now?\" he shouted. \"What d'you want?\" Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say. \"What is that you're wearing, anyway?\" she said, pointing at Snape's chest. \"Your mum's blouse?\" There was a crack: A branch over Petunia's head had fallen. Lily screamed: The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears. \"Tuney!\" But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. \"Did you make that happen?\" \"No.\" He looked both defiant and scared. \"You did!\" She was backing away from him. \"You did ! You hurt her!\" \"No — no I didn't!\" But the lie did not convince Lily: After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused. . . . And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around: He was on platform nine and three-quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister; Harry moved closer to listen. \". . . I'm sorry, Tuney, I'm sorry! Listen —\" She caught her sister's hand and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. \"Maybe once I'm there — no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I'm there, I'll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!\" \"I don't — want — to — go!\" said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister's grasp. \"You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a — a —\" Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their owners' arms, over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some already in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart. \"— you think I want to be a — a freak?\" Lily's eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away. \"I'm not a freak,\" said Lily. \"That's a horrible thing to say.\" \"That's where you're going,\" said Petunia with relish. \"A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy . . . weirdos, that's what you two are. It's good you're being separated from normal people. It's for our safety.\" Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice was low and fierce. \"You didn't think it was such a freak's school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you.\" Petunia turned scarlet. \"Beg? I didn't beg!\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"I saw his reply. It was very kind.\" \"You shouldn't have read —\" whispered Petunia, \"that was my private — how could you — ?\" Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. Petunia gasped. \"That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!\" \"No — not sneaking —\" Now Lily was on the defensive. \"Severus saw the envelope, and he couldn't believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that's all! He says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of —\" \"Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!\" said Petunia, now as pale as she had been flushed. \"Freak!\" she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her parents stood. . . . The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane. Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying. \"I don't want to talk to you,\" she said in a constricted voice. \"Why not?\" \"Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.\" \"So what?\" She threw him a look of deep dislike. \"So she's my sister!\" \"She's only a —\" He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him. \"But we're going!\" he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. \"This is it! We're off to Hogwarts!\" She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. \"You'd better be in Slytherin,\" said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little. \"Slytherin?\" One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked. \"Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?\" James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile. \"My whole family have been in Slytherin,\" he said. \"Blimey,\" said James, \"and I thought you seemed all right!\" Sirius grinned. \"Maybe I'll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you've got the choice?\" James lifted an invisible sword. \" &lsquo;Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad.\" Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. \"Got a problem with that?\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"No,\" said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. \"If you'd rather be brawny than brainy —\" \"Where're you hoping to go, seeing as you're neither?\" interjected Sirius. James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike. \"Come on, Severus, let's find another compartment.\" \"Oooooo . . .\" James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed. \"See ya, Snivellus!\" a voice called, as the compartment door slammed. . . . And the scene dissolved once more. . . . Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, \"Evans, Lily!\" He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, \"Gryffindor!\" Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on him. The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape. Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. \"Slytherin!\" cried the Sorting Hat. And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him. . . . And the scene changed. . . . Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were: A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting. \". . . thought we were supposed to be friends?\" Snape was saying. \"Best friends?\" \"We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?\" Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face. \"That was nothing,\" said Snape. \"It was a laugh, that's all —\" \"It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny —\" \"What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?\" demanded Snape. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment. \"What's Potter got to do with anything?\" said Lily. \"They sneak out at night. There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"He's ill,\" said Lily. \"They say he's ill —\" \"Every month at the full moon?\" said Snape. \"I know your theory,\" said Lily, and she sounded cold. \"Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?\" \"I'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.\" The intensity of his gaze made her blush. \"They don't use Dark Magic, though.\" She dropped her voice. \"And you're being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever's down there —\" Snape's whole face contorted and he spluttered, \"Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends' too! You're not going to — I won't let you —\" \"Let me? Let me?\" Lily's bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once. \"I didn't mean — I just don't want to see you made a fool of — He fancies you, James Potter fancies you!\" The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. \"And he's not . . . everyone thinks . . . big Quidditch hero —\" Snape's bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and Lily's eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead. \"I know James Potter's an arrogant toerag,\" she said, cutting across Snape. \"I don't need you to tell me that. But Mulciber's and Avery's idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don't understand how you can be friends with them.\" Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape's step. . . . And the scene dissolved. . . . Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again. . . . He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snape's defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: \"Mudblood.\" The scene changed. . . . \"I'm sorry.\" \"I'm not interested.\" \"I'm sorry!\" \"Save your breath.\" It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. \"I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.\" \"I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just —\" \"Slipped out?\" There was no pity in Lily's voice. \"It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends — you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that'sCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?\" He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking. \"I can't pretend anymore. You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine.\" \"No — listen, I didn't mean —\" \"— to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?\" He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole. . . . The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone. . . . His fear infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for — Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand. \"Don't kill me!\" \"That was not my intention.\" Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand. \"Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?\" \"No — no message — I'm here on my own account!\" Snape was wringing his hands: He looked a little mad, with his straggling black hair flying around him. \"I — I come with a warning — no, a request — please —\" Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other. \"What request could a Death Eater make of me?\" \"The — the prophecy . . . the prediction . . . Trelawney . . .\" \"Ah, yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?\" \"Everything — everything I heard!\" said Snape. \"That is why — it is for that reason — he thinks it means Lily Evans!\" \"The prophecy did not refer to a woman,\" said Dumbledore. \"It spoke of a boy born at the end of July —\" \"You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down — kill them all —\" \"If she means so much to you,\" said Dumbledore, \"surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?\" \"I have — I have asked him —\" \"You disgust me,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. \"You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?\" Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"Hide them all, then,\" he croaked. \"Keep her — them — safe. Please.\" \"And what will you give me in return, Severus?\" \"In — in return?\" Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, \"Anything.\" The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore's office, and something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop. \"I thought . . . you were going . . . to keep her . . . safe. . . .\" \"She and James put their faith in the wrong person,\" said Dumbledore. \"Rather like you, Severus. Weren't you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?\" Snape's breathing was shallow. \"Her boy survives,\" said Dumbledore. With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly. \"Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and color of Lily Evans's eyes, I am sure?\" \"DON'T!\" bellowed Snape. \"Gone . . . dead . . .\" \"Is this remorse, Severus?\" \"I wish . . . I wish I were dead. . . .\" \"And what use would that be to anyone?\" said Dumbledore coldly. \"If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.\" Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore's words appeared to take a long time to reach him. \"What — what do you mean?\" \"You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily's son.\" \"He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone —\" \"The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.\" There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, \"Very well. Very well. But never — never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear . . . especially Potter's son . . . I want your word!\" \"My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?\" Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape's ferocious, anguished face. \"If you insist . . .\" The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in front of Dumbledore. \"— mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent —\" \"You see what you expect to see, Severus,\" said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. \"Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.\" Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, \"Keep an eye on Quirrell, won't you?\" A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed. \"Well?\" murmured Dumbledore.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"Karkaroff's Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.\" Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore's crooked-nosed profile. \"Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.\" \"Does he?\" said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. \"And are you tempted to join him?\" \"No,\" said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur's and Roger's retreating figures. \"I am not such a coward.\" \"No,\" agreed Dumbledore. \"You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon. . . .\" He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken. . . . And now Harry stood in the headmaster's office yet again. It was nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore's throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore's eyelids fluttered and opened. \"Why,\" said Snape, without preamble, \"why did you put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?\" Marvolo Gaunt's ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it. Dumbledore grimaced. \"I . . . was a fool. Sorely tempted . . .\" \"Tempted by what?\" Dumbledore did not answer. \"It is a miracle you managed to return here!\" Snape sounded furious. \"That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being —\" Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio. \"You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?\" Dumbledore's tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, \"I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.\" Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him. \"I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.\" \"If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, buy you more time!\" said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. \"Did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse?\" \"Something like that . . . I was delirious, no doubt. . . .\" said Dumbledore. With an effort he straightened himself in his chair. \"Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.\" Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled. \"I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.\" Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore's cursed hand, but the otherCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling, Snape said, \"The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius's recent failures. Slow torture for Draco's parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.\" \"In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,\" said Dumbledore. \"Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?\" There was a short pause. \"That, I think, is the Dark Lord's plan.\" \"Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?\" \"He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.\" \"And if it does fall into his grasp,\" said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside, \"I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students of Hogwarts?\" Snape gave a stiff nod. \"Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you —\" \"— much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius's position.\" \"All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort's wrath.\" Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, \"Are you intending to let him kill you?\" \"Certainly not. You must kill me.\" There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone. \"Would you like me to do it now?\" asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. \"Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?\" \"Oh, not quite yet,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"I daresay the moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,\" he indicated his withered hand, \"we can be sure that it will happen within a year.\" \"If you don't mind dying,\" said Snape roughly, \"why not let Draco do it?\" \"That boy's soul is not yet so damaged,\" said Dumbledore. \"I would not have it ripped apart on my account.\" \"And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?\" \"You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation,\" said Dumbledore. \"I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year's league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is involved — I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it.\" His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod. Dumbledore seemed satisfied. \"Thank you, Severus . . .\" The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together?\" Snape asked abruptly. Dumbledore looked weary. \"Why? You aren't trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out.\" \"He is his father over again —\" \"In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother's. I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.\" \"Information,\" repeated Snape. \"You trust him . . . you do not trust me.\" \"It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.\" \"And why may I not have the same information?\" \"I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.\" \"Which I do on your orders!\" \"And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you.\" \"Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord's mind!\" \"Voldemort fears that connection,\" said Dumbledore. \"Not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry's mind means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"Lord Voldemort's soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry's. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame —\" \"Souls? We were talking of minds!\" \"In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the other.\" Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them. \"After you have killed me, Severus —\" \"You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!\" snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now. \"You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!\" \"You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?\" Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed. \"Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you. . . .\" They were back in Dumbledore's office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking. \"Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?\"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"But what must he do?\" \"That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a time — after my death — do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.\" \"For Nagini?\" Snape looked astonished. \"Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.\" \"Tell him what?\" Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. \"Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort's mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.\" Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they were so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears. \"So the boy . . . the boy must die?\" asked Snape quite calmly. \"And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.\" Another long silence. Then Snape said, \"I thought . . . all these years . . . that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.\" \"We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. \"Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth: Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.\" Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified. \"You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?\" \"Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?\" \"Lately, only those whom I could not save,\" said Snape. He stood up. \"You have used me.\" \"Meaning?\" \"I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter —\" \"But this is touching, Severus,\" said Dumbledore seriously. \"Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?\" \"For him?\" shouted Snape. \"Expecto Patronum!\" From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. \"After all this time?\" \"Always,\" said Snape.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk. \"You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry's departure from his aunt and uncle's,\" said Dumbledore. \"Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry's safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly. . . . I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort's good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows. . . .\" Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus's face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration. \"You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,\" Snape murmured, \"that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It is the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?\" \"I understand,\" murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused. . . . Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George. . . . A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin's back — \"Sectumsempra!\" shouted Snape. But the spell, intended for the Death Eater's wand hand, missed and hit George instead — And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius's old bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words: could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind's going, personally! Lots of love, Snape took the page bearing Lily's signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers. . . . And now Snape stood again in the headmaster's study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into his portrait. \"Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood —\" \"Do not use that word!\" \"— the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her!\" \"Good. Very good!\" cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster's chair. \"Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor — and he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry's mind and see you acting for him —\" \"I know,\" said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE \"And you still aren't going to tell me why it's so important to give Potter the sword?\" said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes. \"No, I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore's portrait. \"He will know what to do with it. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley's mishap —\" Snape turned at the door. \"Don't worry, Dumbledore,\" he said coolly. \"I have a plan. . . .\" And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room: Snape might just have closed the door.\n",

      "The next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron's presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look. Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all. \"He loves you,\" he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. \"Won't refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.\" Hermione, however, took a gloomier view. \"He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn't get it out of him,\" she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. \"Horcruxes . . . Horcruxes . . . I've never even heard of them. . . .\" \"You haven't?\" Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were. \"They must be really advanced Dark Magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it's going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you'll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy. . . .\" \"Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon. . . .\" \"Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it,\" she said, flaring up at once. \"After all, when has Won-Won's judgment ever been faulty?\" \"Hermione, can't you — ?\" \"No!\" she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow. Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron. \"What've you done?\" Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione's haughty profile. But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room. \"Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott's Third Law . . . who can tell me — ? But Miss Granger can, of course!\" Hermione recited at top speed: \"Golpalott's-Third-Law-statesthat-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to-more-thanthe-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separate-components.\" \"Precisely!\" beamed Slughorn. \"Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott's Third Law as true . . .\" Harry was going to have to take Slughorn's word for it that Golpalott's Third Law was true, because he had not understood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next either. \". . . which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion's ingredients by Scarpin's Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that added component that will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements —\" Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on. \". . . and so,\" finished Slughorn, \"I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don't forget your protective gloves!\" Hermione had left her stool and was halfway toward Slughorn's desk before the rest of the class had realized it was time to move, and by the time Harry, Ron, and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it. \"It's a shame that the Prince won't be able to help you much with this, Harry,\" she said brightly as she straightened up. \"You have to understand the principles involved this time. No shortcuts or cheats!\" Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Slughorn's desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron, and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced around at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done. \"You sure the Prince hasn't got any tips?\" Ron muttered to Harry. Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes. There was Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it. \"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily. Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, \"Specialis Revelio!\" over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him. It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione's expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince's book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force. And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes: Just shove a bezoar down their throats. Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn't he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn't Snape mentioned them in their first-ever Potions lesson? \"A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.\" It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars. He opened the box just as Slughorn called, \"Two minutes left, everyone!\" Inside were half a dozen shriveled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard, and hurried back to his cauldron. \"Time's . . . UP!\" called Slughorn genially. \"Well, let's see how you've done! Blaise . . . what have you got for me?\" Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand. Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie's potion and passed on to Ron's with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron's cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly. \"And you, Harry,\" he said. \"What have you got to show me?\" Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm. Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter. \"You've got nerve, boy!\" he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. \"Oh, you're like your mother. . . . Well, I can't fault you. . . . A bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!\" Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients, including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry. \"And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?\" she asked through gritted teeth. \"That's the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!\" said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. \"Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it's undoubtedly from Lily he gets it. . . . Yes, Harry, yes, if you've got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick . . . although as they don't work on everything, and are pretty rare, it's still worth knowing how to mix antidotes. . . .\" The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled something that looked like cat-sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang. \"Time to pack up!\" said Slughorn. \"And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!\" Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon. Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room. \"Come on, now, Harry, you'll be late for your next lesson,\" said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragon-skin briefcase. \"Sir,\" said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, \"I wanted to ask you something.\" \"Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away. . . .\" \"Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?\" Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, \"What did you say?\" \"I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see —\" \"Dumbledore put you up to this,\" whispered Slughorn. His voice had changed completely. It was not genial anymore, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow. \"Dumbledore's shown you that — that memory. Well? Hasn't he?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie. \"Yes, of course,\" said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. \"Of course . . . well, if you've seen that memory, Harry, you'll know that I don't know anything — anything\" — he repeated the word forcefully — \"about Horcruxes.\" He seized his dragon-skin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket, and marched to the dungeon door. \"Sir,\" said Harry desperately, \"I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory —\" \"Did you?\" said Slughorn. \"Then you were wrong, weren't you? WRONG!\" He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him. Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview. Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadn't slipped him a bezoar too. \"It would've just looked stupid if we'd both done it!\" said Harry irritably. \"Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn't I? Oh, will you get a grip!\" he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name. Infuriated by his failure and by Ron's and Hermione's attitudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slug-horn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack. When Harry did not question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: Neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him. Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first time in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar. \"I haven't found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!\" she told him. \"Not a single one! I've been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions — nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile — listen — &lsquo;Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction. . . .' I mean, why mention it then?\" she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. \"Oh, shut up,\" she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-gray clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth years' first Apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds. When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender), they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and Sprout — the Heads of Houses — and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colorless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish. \"Good morning,\" said the Ministry wizard, when all the students had arrived and the Heads of Houses had called for quiet. \"My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks. I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time —\" \"Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!\" barked Professor McGonagall. Everybody looked around. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoy's rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his House. \"— by which time, many of you may be ready to take your tests,\" Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption. \"As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practice. May I emphasize that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try. \"I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.\" There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of Houses moved among the students, marshaling them into position and breaking up arguments. \"Harry, where are you going?\" demanded Hermione. But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous. \"I don't know how much longer, all right?\" Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. \"It's taking longer than I thought it would.\" Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say. \"Look, it's none of your business what I'm doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you're told and keep a lookout!\" \"I tell my friends what I'm up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,\" Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him. Malfoy spun around on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, \"Quiet!\" and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front again. \"Thank you,\" said Twycross. \"Now then . . .\" He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student. \"The important things to remember when Apparating are the three D's!\" said Twycross. \"Destination, Determination, Deliberation! \"Step one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,\" said Twycross. \"In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.\" Everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn't stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts. \"Step two,\" said Twycross, \"focus your determination to occupy the visualized space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!\" Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop. \"Step three,\" called Twycross, \"and only when I give the com- mand . . . Turn on the spot, feeling your way into nothingness, moving with deliberation! On my command, now . . . one —\" Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly. \"— two —\" Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three D's stood for. \"— THREE!\" Harry spun on the spot, lost balance, and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him. \"Never mind, never mind,\" said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. \"Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions. . . .\" The second attempt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started. The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified. \"Splinching, or the separation of random body parts,\" said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, \"occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continuously upon your  destination, and move, without haste, but with deliberation . . . thus.\" Twycross stepped forward, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched, and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. \"Remember the three D's,\" he said, \"and try again . . . one — two — three —\" But an hour later, Susan's Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, \"Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destination. Determination. Deliberation.\" With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall. \"How did you do?\" asked Ron, hurrying toward Harry. \"I think I felt something the last time I tried — a kind of tingling in my feet.\" \"I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,\" said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking. \"I didn't feel anything,\" said Harry, ignoring this interruption. \"But I don't care about that now —\" \"What d'you mean, you don't care? Don't you want to learn to Apparate?\" said Ron incredulously. \"I'm not fussed, really, I prefer flying,\" said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall. \"Look, hurry up, will you, there's something I want to do. . . .\" Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole. \"Are you going to tell me what we're doing, then?\" asked Ron, panting slightly. \"Up here,\" said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys' staircase. Their dormitory was, as Harry had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently. \"Harry . . .\" \"Malfoy's using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with Crabbe just now. I want to know — aha.\" He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand. \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . . . or Malfoy is anyway.\" At once, the Marauder's Map appeared on the parchment's surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle's floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of the castle's occupants. \"Help me find Malfoy,\" said Harry urgently. He laid the map upon his bed, and he and Ron leaned over it, searching. \"There!\" said Ron, after a minute or so. \"He's in the Slytherin common room, look . . . with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle . . .\" Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once. \"Well, I'm keeping an eye on him from now on,\" he said firmly. \"And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it'll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he's —\" He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants. Despite his determination to catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high level of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older — Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof. February moved toward March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all common room notice boards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been canceled. Ron was furious. \"It was on my birthday!\" he said. \"I was looking forward to that!\" \"Not a big surprise, though, is it?\" said Harry. \"Not after what happened to Katie.\" She had still not returned from St. Mungo's. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts. \"But now all I've got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!\" said Ron grumpily. \"Big birthday treat . . .\" Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling toward Wilkie Twycross and his three D's, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dogbreath and Dunghead. \"Happy birthday, Ron,\" said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. \"Have a present.\" He threw the package across onto Ron's bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night. \"Cheers,\" said Ron drowsily and, as he ripped off the paper, Harry got out of bed, opened his own trunk, and began rummaging in it for the Marauder's Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. \"Right,\" he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping it quietly and murmuring, \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\" so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear. \"Nice one, Harry!\" said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper's gloves Harry had given him. \"No problem,\" said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. \"Hey . . . I don't think he's in his bed. . . .\" Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure. \"Seriously good haul this year!\" he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. \"See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I'll come of age next year too. . . .\" \"Cool,\" muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast. . . . He was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study. . . . He wasn't in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing. . . . \"Want one?\" said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons. \"No thanks,\" said Harry, looking up. \"Malfoy's gone again!\" \"Can't have done,\" said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. \"Come on, if you don't hurry up, you'll have to Apparate on an empty stomach. . . . Might make it easier, I suppose . . .\" Ron looked thoughtfully at the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third. Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, \"Mischief managed,\" though it hadn't been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy's periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, but even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea: Harry had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework, and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day without his absence being remarked upon. \"Ready?\" he said to Ron. He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely unfocused look on his face. \"Ron? Breakfast.\" \"I'm not hungry.\" Harry stared at him. \"I thought you just said — ?\" \"Well, all right, I'll come down with you,\" sighed Ron, \"but I don't want to eat.\" Harry scrutinized him suspiciously. \"You've just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven't you?\" \"It's not that,\" Ron sighed again. \"You . . . you wouldn't understand.\" \"Fair enough,\" said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door. \"Harry!\" said Ron suddenly. \"What?\" \"Harry, I can't stand it!\" \"You can't stand what?\" asked Harry, now starting to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick. \"I can't stop thinking about her!\" said Ron hoarsely. Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender \"Lav-Lav,\" he would have to put his foot down. \"Why does that stop you having breakfast?\" Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings. \"I don't think she knows I exist,\" said Ron with a desperate gesture. \"She definitely knows you exist,\" said Harry, bewildered. \"She keeps snogging you, doesn't she?\" Ron blinked. \"Who are you talking about?\" \"Who are you talking about?\" said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation. \"Romilda Vane,\" said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, \"This is a joke, right? You're joking.\" \"I think . . . Harry, I think I love her,\" said Ron in a strangled voice. \"Okay,\" said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, \"okay. . . Say that again with a straight face.\" \"I love her,\" repeated Ron breathlessly. \"Have you seen her hair, it's all black and shiny and silky . . . and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her —\" \"This is really funny and everything,\" said Harry impatiently, \"but joke's over, all right? Drop it.\" He turned to leave; he had got two steps toward the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked around. Ron's fist was drawn right back; his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again. Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Levi-corpus! Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once more; he dangled helplessly, upside down, his robes hanging off him. \"What was that for?\" Harry bellowed. \"You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!\" shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head. \"This is insane!\" said Harry. \"What's got into — ?\" And then he saw the box lying open on Ron's bed, and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll. \"Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?\" \"They were a birthday present!\" shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. \"I offered you one, didn't I?\" \"You just picked them up off the floor, didn't you?\" \"They'd fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!\" \"They didn't fall off your bed, you prat, don't you understand? They were mine, I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the map, they're the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas, and they're all spiked with love potion!\" But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron. \"Romilda?\" he repeated. \"Did you say Romilda? Harry — do you know her? Can you introduce me?\" Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him — the part closest to his throbbing right ear — was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off. . . . But on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane. \"Yeah, I'll introduce you,\" said Harry, thinking fast. \"I'm going to let you down now, okay?\" He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning. \"She'll be in Slughorn's office,\" said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door. \"Why will she be in there?\" asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up. \"Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,\" said Harry, inventing wildly. \"Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her?\" said Ron eagerly. \"Great idea,\" said Harry. Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not foreseen. \"You're late, Won-Won!\" she pouted. \"I've got you a birthday —\" \"Leave me alone,\" said Ron impatiently. \"Harry's going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.\" And without another word to her, he pushed his way out of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them. Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed. \"Harry,\" he mumbled. \"This is very early for a call. . . . I generally sleep late on a Saturday. . . .\" \"Professor, I'm really sorry to disturb you,\" said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, \"but my friend Ron's swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldn't make him an antidote, could you? I'd take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we're not supposed to have anything from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and, you know . . . awkward questions . . .\" \"I'd have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?\" asked Slughorn. \"Er,\" said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, \"well, I've never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right, Ron might've done something serious —\" Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, \"I can't see her, Harry — is he hiding her?\" \"Was this potion within date?\" asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with professional interest. \"They can strengthen, you know, the longer they're kept.\" \"That would explain a lot,\" panted Harry, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. \"It's his birthday, Professor,\" he added imploringly. \"Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,\" said Slughorn, relenting. \"I've got the necessary here in my bag, it's not a difficult antidote. . . .\" Ron burst through the door into Slughorn's overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasseled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck, and muttered, \"She didn't see that, did she?\" \"She's not here yet,\" said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle. \"That's good,\" said Ron fervently. \"How do I look?\" \"Very handsome,\" said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. \"Now drink that up, it's a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know.\" \"Brilliant,\" said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily. Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and vanished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror. \"Back to normal, then?\" said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. \"Thanks a lot, Professor.\" \"Don't mention it, m'boy, don't mention it,\" said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. \"Pickme-up, that's what he needs,\" Slughorn continued, now bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. \"I've got butterbeer, I've got wine, I've got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead . . . hmm . . . meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas . . . ah, well . . .\" He shrugged. \"He can't miss what he's never had! Why don't we open it now and celebrate Mr. Weasley's birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love. . . .\" He chortled again, and Harry joined in. This was the first time he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood . . . perhaps if they got through enough of the oak-matured mead . . . \"There you are then,\" said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each before raising his own. \"Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph —\" \"Ron —\" whispered Harry. But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it. There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not. \"— and may you have many more —\" \"Ron!\" Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth, and his eyes were bulging from their sockets. \"Professor!\" Harry bellowed. \"Do something!\" But Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: His skin was turning blue. \"What — but —\" spluttered Slughorn. Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward Slughorn's open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron's gargling breath filled the room. Then he found it — the shriveled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions. He hurtled back to Ron's side, wrenched open his jaw, and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp, and his body became limp and still.\n",

      "Hermione made no mention of Harry giving Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion. Harry's detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched on the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape. \"I was wondering,\" Hermione said suddenly, \"whether you'd thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry.\" \" 'Course I have,\" said Harry grumpily. \"Can't forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us —\" \"I meant the idea Ron and I had\" — Ron cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look; she frowned at him — \"oh, all right, the idea I had, then — about you teaching us.\" Harry did not answer at once. He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his mind. The fact was that he had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters — found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons. . . . \"Well,\" he said slowly, when he could not pretend to find Asiatic anti-venoms interesting much longer, \"yeah, I — I've thought about it a bit.\" \"And?\" said Hermione eagerly. \"I dunno,\" said Harry, playing for time. He looked up at Ron. \"I thought it was a good idea from the start,\" said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure that Harry was not going to start shouting again. Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair. \"You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn't you?\" \"Yes, Harry,\" said Hermione gently, \"but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't, Viktor always said —\" Ron looked around at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck; rubbing it, he said, \"Yeah? What did Vicky say?\" \"Ho ho,\" said Hermione in a bored voice. \"He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn't, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang.\" Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously. \"You're not still in contact with him, are you?\" \"So what if I am?\" said Hermione coolly, though her face was a little pink. \"I can have a pen pal if I —\" \"He didn't only want to be your pen pal,\" said Ron accusingly. Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ron, who was continuing to watch her, said to Harry, \"Well, what do you think? Will you teach us?\" \"Just you and Ron, yeah?\" \"Well,\" said Hermione, now looking a mite anxious again. \"Well . . . now, don't fly off the handle again, Harry, please. . . . But I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we're talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort — oh, don't be pathetic, Ron — it doesn't seem fair if we don't offer the chance to other people.\" Harry considered this for a moment, then said, \"Yeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I'm a nutter, remember?\" \"Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you've got to say,\" said Hermione seriously. \"Look,\" she leaned toward him; Ron, who was still watching her with a frown on his face, leaned forward to listen too, \"you know the first weekend in October's a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone who's interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over?\" \"Why do we have to do it outside school?\" said Ron. \"Because,\" said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, \"I don't think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.\" Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying that they did not want him to come — but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway. What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy? \"Well, you can't blame him for wanting to get out and about,\" said Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione. \"I mean, he's been on the run for over two years, hasn't he, and I know that can't have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn't he? And now he's just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf.\" Hermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on Kreacher. \"The trouble is,\" she said to Harry, \"until V-Voldemort — oh for heaven's sake, Ron — comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn't he? I mean, the stupid Ministry isn't going to realize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore's been telling the truth about him all along. And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again it'll be obvious Sirius isn't one . . . I mean, he hasn't got the Mark, for one thing.\" \"I don't reckon he'd be stupid enough to turn up,\" said Ron bracingly. \"Dumbledore'd go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesn't like what he hears.\" When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, \"Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested. We've told them to meet us in Hogsmeade.\" \"Right,\" said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius. \"Don't worry, Harry,\" Hermione said quietly. \"You've got enough on your plate without Sirius too.\" She was quite right, of course; he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch practices twice a week, Ron also had prefect duties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks. The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. After breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it hadn't been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all. When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out onto the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day. \"Er — why was Filch sniffing you?\" asked Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates. \"I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,\" said Harry with a small laugh. \"I forgot to tell you . . .\" And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself. \"He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who had tipped him off?\" \"I dunno,\" said Harry, shrugging. \"Maybe Malfoy, he'd think it was a laugh.\" They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left onto the road into the village, the wind whipping their hair into their eyes. \"Malfoy?\" said Hermione, very skeptically. \"Well . . . yes . . . maybe . . .\" And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade. \"Where are we going anyway?\" Harry asked. \"The Three Broomsticks?\" \"Oh — no,\" said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, \"no, it's always packed and really noisy. I've told the others to meet us in the Hog's Head, that other pub, you know the one, it's not on the main road. I think it's a bit . . . you know . . . dodgy . . . but students don't normally go in there, so I don't think we'll be overheard.\" They walked down the main street past Zonko's Joke Shop, where they were unsurprised to see Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture upon it of a wild boar's severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them hesitated outside the door. \"Well, come on,\" said Hermione slightly nervously. Harry led the way inside. It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog's Head bar comprised one small, dingy, and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as Harry stepped onto it he realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries. Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: \"Yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head,\" he had said, explaining how he had won a dragons egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog's Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth. Two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents; in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly. \"I don't know about this, Hermione,\" Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch. \"Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?\" Hermione cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure. \"Umbridge is shorter than that woman,\" she said quietly. \"And anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there's nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, because I've double- and triple-checked the school rules. We're not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog's Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I've looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they're definitely allowed. I just don't think it's a good idea if we parade what we're doing.\" \"No,\" said Harry dryly, \"especially as it's not exactly a homework group you're planning, is it?\" The barman sidled toward them out of a back room. He was a grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long gray hair and beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry. \"What?\" he grunted. \"Three butterbeers, please,\" said Hermione. The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar. \"Six Sickles,\" he said. \"I'll get them,\" said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The barman's eyes traveled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry's money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry, Ron, and Hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman. \"You know what?\" Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. \"We could order anything we liked in here, I bet that bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn't care. I've always wanted to try firewhisky —\" \"You — are — a — prefect,\" snarled Hermione. \"Oh,\" said Ron, the smile fading from his face. \"Yeah . . .\" \"So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?\" Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig. \"Just a couple of people,\" Hermione repeated, checking her watch and then looking anxiously toward the door. \"I told them to be here about now and I'm sure they all know where it is — oh look, this might be them now —\" The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people. First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back flip) Cho and one of her usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise. \"A couple of people?\" said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. \"A couple of people?\" \"Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,\" said Hermione happily. \"Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?\" The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly he had never seen his pub so full. \"Hi,\" said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly. \"Could we have . . . twenty-five butterbeers, please?\" The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the bar. \"Cheers,\" said Fred, handing them out. \"Cough up, everyone, I haven't got enough gold for all of these. . . .\" Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione. \"What have you been telling people?\" he said in a low voice. \"What are they expecting?\" \"I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,\" said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, \"You don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first.\" \"Hi, Harry,\" said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite Harry. Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told Harry plainly that, given her way, she would not be here at all. In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron, and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Love-good gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry. \"Er,\" said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. \"Well — er — hi.\" The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry. \"Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you're here. Erm . . . well, Harry here had the idea — I mean\" — Harry had thrown her a sharp look — \"I had the idea — that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts — and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us\" — (Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) — \"because nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts\" — \"Hear, hear,\" said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened — \"well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.\" She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, \"And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just theory but the real spells —\" \"You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. too though, I bet?\" said Michael Corner. \"Of course I do,\" said Hermione at once. \"But I want more than that, I want to be properly trained in Defense because . . . because . . .\" She took a great breath and finished, \"Because Lord Voldemort's back.\" The reaction was immediate and predictable. Cho's friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down herself, Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch, Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry. \"Well . . . that's the plan anyway,\" said Hermione. \"If you want to join us, we need to decide how we're going to —\" \"Where's the proof You-Know-Who's back?\" said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice. \"Well, Dumbledore believes it —\" Hermione began. \"You mean, Dumbledore believes him,\" said the blond boy, nodding at Harry. \"Who are you?\" said Ron rather rudely. \"Zacharias Smith,\" said the boy, \"and I think we've got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who's back.\" \"Look,\" said Hermione, intervening swiftly, \"that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about —\" \"It's okay, Hermione,\" said Harry. It had just dawned upon him why there were so many people there. He felt that Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these people — maybe even most of them — had turned up in the hope of hearing Harry's story firsthand. \"What makes me say You-Know-Who's back?\" he asked, looking Zacharias straight in the face. \"I saw him. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn't believe him,  you don't believe me, and I'm not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.\" The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke. Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening in. He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag; it was becoming steadily dirtier. Zacharias said dismissively, \"All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory's body back to Hogwarts. He didn't give us details, he didn't tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we'd all like to know —\" \"If you've come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can't help you,\" Harry said. His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith's aggressive face, determined not to look at Cho. \"I don't want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that's what you're here for, you might as well clear out.\" He cast an angry look in Hermione's direction. This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just how wild his story was. . . . But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry. \"So,\" said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. \"So . . . like I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defense, then we need to work out how we're going to do it, how often we're going to meet, and where we're going to —\" \"Is it true,\" interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry, \"that you can produce a Patronus?\" There was a murmur of interest around the group at this. \"Yeah,\" said Harry slightly defensively. \"A corporeal Patronus?\" The phrase stirred something in Harry's memory. \"Er — you don't know Madam Bones, do you?\" he asked. The girl smiled. \"She's my auntie,\" she said. \"I'm Susan Bones. She told me about your hearing. So — is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Blimey, Harry!\" said Lee, looking deeply impressed. \"I never knew that!\" \"Mum told Ron not to spread it around,\" said Fred, grinning at Harry. \"She said you got enough attention as it was.\" \"She's not wrong,\" mumbled Harry and a couple of people laughed. The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat. \"And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore's office?\" demanded Terry Boot. \"That's what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year. . . .\" \"Er — yeah, I did, yeah,\" said Harry. Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled, the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks, and Lavender Brown said \"wow\" softly. Harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly looking anywhere but at Cho. \"And in our first year,\" said Neville to the group at large, \"he saved that Sorcerous Stone —\" \"Sorcerer's,\" hissed Hermione. \"Yes, that, from You-Know-Who,\" finished Neville. Hannah Abbott's eyes were as round as Galleons. \"And that's not to mention,\" said Cho (Harry's eyes snapped onto her, she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault), \"all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year — getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and things. . . .\" There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. Harry's insides were squirming. He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself. The fact that Cho had just praised him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them. \"Look,\" he said and everyone fell silent at once, \"I . . . I don't want to sound like I'm trying to be modest or anything, but . . . I had a lot of help with all that stuff. . . .\" \"Not with the dragon, you didn't,\" said Michael Corner at once. \"That was a seriously cool bit of flying. . . .\" \"Yeah, well —\" said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree. \"And nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer,\" said Susan Bones. \"No,\" said Harry, \"no, okay, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I'm trying to make is —\" \"Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?\" said Zacharias Smith. \"Here's an idea,\" said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, \"why don't you shut your mouth?\" Perhaps the word \"weasel\" had affected Ron particularly strongly; in any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias flushed. \"Well, we've all turned up to learn from him, and now he's telling us he can't really do any of it,\" he said. \"That's not what he said,\" snarled Fred Weasley. \"Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?\" inquired George, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko's bags. \"Or any part of your body, really, we're not fussy where we stick this,\" said Fred. \"Yes, well,\" said Hermione hastily, \"moving on . . . the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?\" There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded his arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in George's hand. \"Right,\" said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled. \"Well, then, the next question is how often we do it. I really don't think there's any point in meeting less than once a week —\" \"Hang on,\" said Angelina, \"we need to make sure this doesn't clash with our Quidditch practice.\" \"No,\" said Cho, \"nor with ours.\" \"Nor ours,\" added Zacharias Smith. \"I'm sure we can find a night that suits everyone,\" said Hermione, slightly impatiently, \"but you know, this is rather important, we're talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort's Death Eaters —\" \"Well said!\" barked Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry had been expecting to speak long before this. \"Personally I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we'll do this year, even with our O.W.L.s coming up!\" He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry, \"Surely not!\" When nobody spoke, he went on, \"I, personally, am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us at this critical period. Obviously they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells —\" \"We think the reason Umbridge doesn't want us trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione, \"is that she's got some . . . some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army. She thinks he'd mobilize us against the Ministry.\" Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna Lovegood, who piped up, \"Well, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army.\" \"What?\" said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information. \"Yes, he's got an army of heliopaths,\" said Luna solemnly. \"No, he hasn't,\" snapped Hermione. \"Yes, he has,\" said Luna. \"What are heliopaths?\" asked Neville, looking blank. \"They're spirits of fire,\" said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever. \"Great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of —\" \"They don't exist, Neville,\" said Hermione tartly. \"Oh yes they do!\" said Luna angrily. \"I'm sorry, but where's the proof of that?\" snapped Hermione. \"There are plenty of eyewitness accounts, just because you're so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Ginny in such a good imitation of Professor Um-bridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. \"Weren't we trying to decide how often we're going to meet and get Defense lessons?\" \"Yes,\" said Hermione at once, \"yes, we were, you're right. . . .\" \"Well, once a week sounds cool,\" said Lee Jordan. \"As long as —\" began Angelina. \"Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,\" said Hermione in a tense voice. \"Well, the other thing to decide is where we're going to meet. . . .\" This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent. \"Library?\" suggested Katie Bell after a few moments. \"I can't see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,\" said Harry. \"Maybe an unused classroom?\" said Dean. \"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry was practicing for the Triwizard. . . .\" But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling this one might be considered a lot more rebellious. \"Right, well, we'll try to find somewhere,\" said Hermione. \"We'll send a message round to everybody when we've got a time and a place for the first meeting.\" She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say something. \"I-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think,\" she took a deep breath, \"that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we're doing. So if you sign, you're agreeing not to tell Umbridge — or anybody else — what we're up to.\" Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully put down his signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list. \"Er . . .\" said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass him. \"Well . . . I'm sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is.\" But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing too. Hermione raised her eyebrows at him. \"I — well, we are prefects,\" Ernie burst out. \"And if this list was found . . . well, I mean to say . . . you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out . . .\" \"You just said this group was the most important thing you'd do this year,\" Harry reminded him. \"I — yes,\" said Ernie, \"yes, I do believe that, it's just . . .\" \"Ernie, do you really think I'd leave that list lying around?\" said Hermione testily. \"No. No, of course not,\" said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious. \"I — yes, of course I'll sign.\" Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho's friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her name. When the last person — Zacharias — had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an odd feeling in the group now. It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract. \"Well, time's ticking on,\" said Fred briskly, getting to his feet. \"George, Lee, and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we'll be seeing you all later.\" In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave too. Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide her face, but her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered her through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry. \"Well, I think that went quite well,\" said Hermione happily, as she, Harry, and Ron walked out of the Hog's Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later, Harry and Ron still clutching their bottles of butterbeer. \"That Zacharias bloke's a wart,\" said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith just discernible in the distance. \"I don't like him much either,\" admitted Hermione, \"but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more people the better really — I mean, Michael Corner and his friends wouldn't have come if he hadn't been going out with Ginny —\" Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front. \"He's WHAT?\" said Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef. \"She's going out with — my sister's going — what d'you mean, Michael Corner?\" \"Well, that's why he and his friends came, I think — well, they're obviously interested in learning defense, but if Ginny hadn't told Michael what was going on —\" \"When did this — when did she — ?\" \"They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at the end of last year,\" said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High Street and she paused outside Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop, where there was a handsome display of pheasant-feather quills in the window. \"Hmm . . . I could do with a new quill.\" She turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed her. \"Which one was Michael Corner?\" Ron demanded furiously. \"The dark one,\" said Hermione. \"I didn't like him,\" said Ron at once. \"Big surprise,\" said Hermione under her breath. \"But,\" said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots, \"I thought Ginny fancied Harry!\" Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head. \"Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago. Not that she doesn't like you, of course,\" she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long black-and-gold quill. Harry, whose head was still full of Cho's parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered. \"So that's why she talks now?\" he asked Hermione. \"She never used to talk in front of me.\" \"Exactly,\" said Hermione. \"Yes, I think I'll have this one. . . .\" She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts, Ron still breathing down her neck. \"Ron,\" she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, \"this is exactly why Ginny hasn't told you she's seeing Michael, she knew you'd take it badly. So don't harp on about it, for heaven's sake.\" \"What d'you mean, who's taking anything badly? I'm not going to harp on about anything . . .\" Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street. Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, \"And talking about Michael and Ginny . . . what about Cho and you?\" \"What d'you mean?\" said Harry quickly. It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold — had he been that obvious? \"Well,\" said Hermione, smiling slightly, \"she just couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?\" Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was.\n",

      "Harry sprinted up to the boys' dormitory to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map from his trunk; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls' dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats. \"Well, it's cold out there!\" she said defensively, as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently. They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the cloak — Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing — then, moving slowly and cautiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Norris. They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like \"Weasley Is Our King.\" They crept across the entrance hall and then out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid's chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind him, and they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door; when Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside. \"Hagrid, it's us!\" Harry called through the keyhole. \"Shoulda known!\" said a gruff voice. They beamed at one another under the cloak; they could tell that Hagrid's voice was pleased. \"Bin home three seconds . . . Out the way, Fang . . . Out the way, yeh dozy dog . . .\" The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open, and Hagrid's head appeared in the gap. Hermione screamed. \"Merlin's beard, keep it down!\" said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. \"Under that cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!\" \"I'm sorry!\" Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them. \"I just — oh, Hagrid !\" \"It's nuthin', it's nuthin'!\" said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror. Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood, and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple-and-black bruises. There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleeding, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home; a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man and three times as broad, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it. \"What happened to you?\" Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick their faces. \"Told yeh, nuthin',\" said Hagrid firmly. \"Want a cuppa?\" \"Come off it,\" said Ron, \"you're in a right state!\" \"I'm tellin' yeh, I'm fine,\" said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing. \"Blimey, it's good ter see you three again — had good summers, did yeh?\" \"Hagrid, you've been attacked!\" said Ron. \"Fer the las' time, it's nuthin'!\" said Hagrid firmly. \"Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?\" Ron demanded. \"You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,\" said Hermione anxiously. \"Some of those cuts look nasty.\" \"I'm dealin' with it, all righ'?\" said Hagrid repressively. He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire. \"You're not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?\" said Ron, leaning in for a closer look. \"It looks poisonous.\" \"It's s'posed ter look like that, it's dragon meat,\" Hagrid said. \"An' I didn' get it ter eat.\" He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face. Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction. \"Tha's better. It helps with the stingin', yeh know.\" \"So are you going to tell us what's happened to you?\" Harry asked. \"Can', Harry. Top secret. More'n me job's worth ter tell yeh that.\" \"Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione quietly. Hagrid's fingers slipped on the dragon steak, and it slid squelchily onto his chest. \"Giants?\" said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face. \"Who said anythin' abou' giants?  Who yeh bin talkin' to? Who's told yeh what I've — who's said I've bin — eh?\" \"We guessed,\" said Hermione apologetically. \"Oh, yeh did, did yeh?\" said Hagrid, fixing her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak. \"It was kind of . . . obvious,\" said Ron. Harry nodded. Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak onto the table again and strode back to the kettle, which was now whistling. \"Never known kids like you three fer knowin' more'n yeh oughta,\" he muttered, splashing boiling water into three of his bucket-shaped mugs. \"An' I'm not complimentin' yeh, neither. Nosy, some'd call it. Interferin'.\" But his beard twitched. \"So you have been to look for giants?\" said Harry, grinning as he sat down at the table. Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his steak again, and slapped it back over his face. \"Yeah, all righ',\" he grunted, \"I have.\" \"And you found them?\" said Hermione in a hushed voice. \"Well, they're not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,\" said Hagrid. \"Pretty big, see.\" \"Where are they?\" said Ron. \"Mountains,\" said Hagrid unhelpfully. \"So why don't Muggles — ?\" \"They do,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"O'ny their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin' accidents, aren' they?\" He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising. \"Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you've been up to!\" said Ron. \"Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors —\" Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea, and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft splat, onto the floor. \"Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?\" growled Hagrid. \"Didn't you know?\" Hermione asked him, wide-eyed. \"I don' know anything that's been happenin' since I left. I was on a secret mission, wasn' I, didn' wan' owls followin' me all over the place — ruddy dementors! Yeh're not serious?\" \"Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me —\" \"WHAT?\" \"— and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first.\" \"You were expelled?\" \"Tell us about your summer and I'll tell you about mine.\" Hagrid glared at him through his one open eye. Harry looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on his face. \"Oh, all righ',\" Hagrid said in a resigned voice. He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang's mouth. \"Oh, Hagrid, don't, it's not hygien —\" Hermione began, but Ha-grid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye. He took another fortifying gulp of tea and then said, \"Well, we set off righ' after term ended —\" \"Madame Maxime went with you, then?\" Hermione interjected. \"Yeah, tha's right,\" said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak. \"Yeah, it was jus' the pair of us. An' I'll tell yeh this, she's not afraid of roughin' it, Olympe. Yeh know, she's a fine, well-dressed woman, an' knowin' where we was goin' I wondered 'ow she'd feel abou' clamberin' over boulders an' sleepin' in caves an' tha', bu' she never complained once.\" \"You knew where you were going?\" Harry asked. \"You knew where the giants were?\" \"Well, Dumbledore knew, an' he told us,\" said Hagrid. \"Are they hidden?\" asked Ron. \"Is it a secret, where they are?\" \"Not really,\" said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head. \"It's jus' that mos' wizards aren' bothered where they are, s' long as it's a good long way away. But where they are's very difficult ter get ter, fer humans anyway, so we needed Dumbledore's instructions. Took us abou' a month ter get there —\" \"A month?\" said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time. \"But — why couldn't you just grab a Portkey or something?\" There was an odd expression in Hagrid's unobscured eye as he squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying. \"We're bein' watched, Ron,\" he said gruffly. \"What d'you mean?\" \"Yeh don' understand,\" said Hagrid. \"The Ministry's keepin' an eye on Dumbledore an' anyone they reckon's in league with him, an' —\" \"We know about that,\" said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest of Hagrid's story. \"We know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore —\" \"So you couldn't use magic to get there?\" asked Ron, looking thunderstruck. \"You had to act like Muggles all the way?\" \"Well, not exactly all the way,\" said Hagrid cagily. \"We jus' had ter be careful, 'cause Olympe an' me, we stick out a bit —\" Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea. \"— so we're not hard ter follow. We was pretendin' we was goin' on holiday together, so we got inter France an' we made like we was headin' fer where Olympe's school is, 'cause we knew we was bein' tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, 'cause I'm not really s'posed ter use magic an' we knew the Ministry'd be lookin' fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin' us the slip round abou' Dee-John —\" \"Ooooh, Dijon?\" said Hermione excitedly. \"I've been there on holiday, did you see — ?\" She fell silent at the look on Ron's face. \"We chanced a bit o' magic after that, and it wasn' a bad journey. Ran inter a couple o' mad trolls on the Polish border, an' I had a sligh' disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha', couldn't'a bin smoother. \"An' then we reached the place, an' we started trekkin' up through the mountains, lookin' fer signs of 'em . . . \"We had ter lay off the magic once we got near 'em. Partly 'cause they don' like wizards an' we didn' want ter put their backs up too soon, and partly 'cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an' all. Said it was odds on he'd sent a messenger off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin' attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.\" Hagrid paused for a long draft of tea. \"Go on!\" said Harry urgently. \"Found 'em,\" said Hagrid baldly. \"Went over a ridge one nigh' an' there they was, spread ou' underneath us. Little fires burnin' below an' huge shadows . . . It was like watchin' bits o' the mountain movin'.\" \"How big are they?\" asked Ron in a hushed voice. \" 'Bout twenty feet,\" said Hagrid casually. \"Some o' the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.\" \"And how many were there?\" asked Harry. \"I reckon abou' seventy or eighty,\" said Hagrid. \"Is that all?\" said Hermione. \"Yep,\" said Hagrid sadly, \"eighty left, an' there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff'rent tribes from all over the world. But they've bin dyin' out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o' course, but  mostly they killed each other, an' now they're dyin' out faster than ever. They're not made ter live bunched up together like tha'. Dumbledore says it's our fault, it was the wizards who forced 'em to go an' made 'em live a good long way from us an' they had no choice but ter stick together fer their own protection.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"you saw them and then what?\" \"Well, we waited till morning, didn' want ter go sneakin' up on 'em in the dark, fer our own safety,\" said Hagrid. \" 'Bout three in the mornin' they fell asleep jus' where they was sittin'. We didn' dare sleep. Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of 'em woke up an' came up where we were, an' fer another, the snorin' was unbelievable. Caused an avalanche near mornin'. \"Anyway, once it was light we wen' down ter see 'em.\" \"Just like that?\" said Ron, looking awestruck. \"You just walked right into a giant camp?\" \"Well, Dumbledore'd told us how ter do it,\" said Hagrid. \"Give the Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.\" \"Give the what gifts?\" asked Harry. \"Oh, the Gurg — means the chief.\" \"How could you tell which one was the Gurg?\" asked Ron. Hagrid grunted in amusement. \"No problem,\" he said. \"He was the biggest, the ugliest, an' the laziest. Sittin' there waitin' ter be brought food by the others. Dead goats an' such like. Name o' Karkus. I'd put him at twenty-two, twenty-three feet, an' the weight of a couple o' bull elephants. Skin like rhino hide an' all.\" \"And you just walked up to him?\" said Hermione breathlessly. \"Well . . . down ter him, where he was lyin' in the valley. They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an' Karkus was lyin' by the lake roarin' at the others ter feed him an' his wife. Olympe an' I went down the mountainside —\" \"But didn't they try and kill you when they saw you?\" asked Ron incredulously. \"It was def'nitely on some of their minds,\" said Hagrid, shrugging, \"but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an' keep our eyes on the Gurg an' ignore the others. So tha's what we did. An' the rest of 'em went quiet an' watched us pass an' we got right up ter Karkus's feet an' we bowed an' put our present down in front o' him.\" \"What do you give a giant?\" asked Ron eagerly. \"Food?\" \"Nah, he can get food all righ' fer himself,\" said Hagrid. \"We took him magic. Giants like magic, jus' don't like us usin' it against 'em. Anyway, that firs' day we gave him a branch o' Gubraithian fire.\" Hermione said \"wow\" softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement. \"A branch of — ?\" \"Everlasting fire,\" said Hermione irritably, \"you ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick's mentioned it at least twice in class!\" \"Well anyway,\" said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, \"Dumbledore'd bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn' somethin' any wizard could do, an' so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus's feet and says, &lsquo;A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.' \" \"And what did Karkus say?\" asked Harry eagerly. \"Nothin',\" said Hagrid. \"Didn' speak English.\" \"You're kidding!\" \"Didn' matter,\" said Hagrid imperturbably, \"Dumbledore had warned us tha' migh' happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o' giants who knew our lingo an' they translated fer us.\" \"And did he like the present?\" asked Ron. \"Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,\" said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye. \"Very pleased. So then I said, &lsquo;Albus Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift.' \" \"Why couldn't you speak to them that day?\" asked Hermione. \"Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,\" said Hagrid. \"Let 'em see we kept our promises. We'll come back tomorrow with another present, an' then we do come back with another present — gives a good impression, see? An' gives them time ter test out the firs' present an' find out it's a good one, an' get 'em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus — overload 'em with information an' they'll kill yeh jus' to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an' went off an' found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in, an' the followin' mornin' we went back an' this time we found Karkus sittin' up waitin' fer us lookin' all eager.\" \"And you talked to him?\" \"Oh yeah. Firs' we presented him with a nice battle helmet — goblin-made an' indestructible, yeh know — an' then we sat down an' we talked.\" \"What did he say?\" \"Not much,\" said Hagrid. \"Listened mostly. But there were good signs. He'd heard o' Dumbledore, heard he'd argued against the killin' of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int'rested in what Dumbledore had ter say. An' a few o' the others, 'specially the ones who had some English, they gathered round an' listened too. We were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next day with another present. \"But that night it all wen' wrong.\" \"What d'you mean?\" said Ron quickly. \"Well, like I say, they're not meant ter live together, giants,\" said Hagrid sadly. \"Not in big groups like that. They can' help themselves, they half kill each other every few weeks. The men fight each other an'  the women fight each other, the remnants of the old tribes fight each other, an' that's even without squabbles over food an' the best fires an' sleepin' spots. Yeh'd think, seein' as how their whole race is abou' finished, they'd lay off each other, but . . .\" Hagrid sighed deeply \"That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin' down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn' believe the noise. An' when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an' his head was lyin' at the bottom o' the lake.\" \"Whose head?\" gasped Hermione. \"Karkus's,\" said Hagrid heavily. \"There was a new Gurg, Golgomath.\" He sighed deeply. \"Well, we hadn' bargained on a new Gurg two days after we'd made friendly contact with the firs' one, an' we had a funny feelin' Golgomath wouldn' be so keen ter listen to us, but we had ter try.\" \"You went to speak to him?\" asked Ron incredulously. \"After you'd watched him rip off another giant's head?\" \" 'Course we did,\" said Hagrid, \"we hadn' gone all that way ter give up after two days! We wen' down with the next present we'd meant ter give ter Karkus. \"I knew it was no go before I'd opened me mouth. He was sitting there wearin' Karkus's helmet, leerin' at us as we got nearer. He's massive, one o' the biggest ones there. Black hair an' matchin' teeth an' a necklace o' bones. Human-lookin' bones, some of 'em. Well, I gave it a go — held out a great roll o' dragon skin — an' said A gift fer the Gurg of the giants —' Nex' thing I knew, I was hangin' upside down in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me.\" Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth. \"How did you get out of that?\" asked Harry. \"Wouldn'ta done if Olympe hadn' bin there,\" said Hagrid. \"She pulled out her wand an' did some o' the fastes' spellwork I've ever seen. Ruddy marvelous. Hit the two holdin' me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an' they dropped me straightaway — bu' we were in trouble then, 'cause we'd used magic against 'em, an' that's what giants hate abou' wizards. We had ter leg it an' we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again.\" \"Blimey, Hagrid,\" said Ron quietly. \"So how come it's taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?\" asked Hermione. \"We didn' leave after three days!\" said Hagrid, looking outraged. \"Dumbledore was relyin' on us!\" \"But you've just said there was no way you could go back!\" \"Not by daylight, we couldn', no. We just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o' days lyin' low up in the cave an' watchin'. An' wha' we saw wasn' good.\" \"Did he rip off more heads?\" asked Hermione, sounding squeamish. \"No,\" said Hagrid. \"I wish he had.\" \"What d'you mean?\" \"I mean we soon found out he didn' object ter all wizards — just us.\" \"Death Eaters?\" said Harry quickly. \"Yep,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"Couple of 'em were visitin' him ev'ry day, bringin' gifts ter the Gurg, an' he wasn' dangling them upside down.\" \"How d'you know they were Death Eaters?\" said Ron. \"Because I recognized one of 'em,\" Hagrid growled. \"Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes killin' as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin' on so well.\" \"So Macnair's persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?\" said Hermione desperately. \"Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven' finished me story yet!\" said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. \"Me  an' Olympe talked it over an' we agreed, jus' 'cause the Gurg looked like favorin' You-Know-Who didn' mean all of 'em would. We had ter try an' persuade some o' the others, the ones who hadn' wanted Golgomath as Gurg.\" \"How could you tell which ones they were?\" asked Ron. \"Well, they were the ones bein' beaten to a pulp, weren' they?\" said Hagrid patiently. \"The ones with any sense were keepin' outta Golgomath's way, hidin' out in caves roun' the gully jus' like we were. So we decided we'd go pokin' round the caves by night an' see if we couldn' persuade a few o' them.\" \"You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?\" said Ron with awed respect in his voice. \"Well, it wasn' the giants who worried us most,\" said Hagrid. \"We were more concerned abou' the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us before we wen' not ter tangle with 'em if we could avoid it, an' the trouble was they knew we was around — 'spect Golgomath told him abou' us. At night when the giants were sleepin' an' we wanted ter be creepin' inter the caves, Macnair an' the other one were sneakin' round the mountains lookin' fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin' out at them,\" said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard. \"She was rarin' ter attack 'em. . . . she's somethin' when she's roused, Olympe. . . . Fiery, yeh know . . . 'spect it's the French in her . . .\" Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty seconds' reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly. \"So what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?\" \"What? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin' in and headed back down inter the gully, keepin' our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o' the caves, no go — then, in abou' the sixth one, we found three giants hidin'.\" \"Cave must've been cramped,\" said Ron. \"Wasn' room ter swing a kneazle,\" said Hagrid. \"Didn't they attack you when they saw you?\" asked Hermione. \"Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,\" said Ha-grid, \"but they was badly hurt, all three o' them. Golgomath's lot had beaten 'em unconscious; they'd woken up an' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o' them had a bit of English an' 'e translated fer the others, an' what we had ter say didn' seem ter go down too badly. So we kep' goin' back, visitin' the wounded. . . . I reckon we had abou' six or seven o' them convinced at one poin'.\" \"Six or seven?\" said Ron eagerly. \"Well that's not bad — are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?\" But Hermione said, \"What do you mean &lsquo;at one point,' Hagrid?\" Hagrid looked at her sadly. \"Golgomath's lot raided the caves. The ones tha' survived didn' wan' no more ter to do with us after that.\" \"So . . . so there aren't any giants coming?\" said Ron, looking disappointed. \"Nope,\" said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak again and applied the cooler side to his face, \"but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave 'em Dumbledore's message an' some o' them heard it an' I 'spect some o' them'll remember it. Jus' maybe, them that don' want ter stay around Golgomath'll move outta the mountains, an' there's gotta be a chance they'll remember Dumbledore's friendly to 'em. . . . Could be they'll come . . .\" Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap. \"Hagrid?\" said Hermione quietly after a while. \"Mmm?\" \"Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything about your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?\" Hagrid's unobscured eye rested upon her, and Hermione looked rather scared. \"I'm sorry . . . I . . . forget it —\" \"Dead,\" Hagrid grunted. \"Died years ago. They told me.\" \"Oh . . . I'm . . . I'm really sorry,\" said Hermione in a very small voice. Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. \"No need,\" he said shortly. \"Can' remember her much. Wasn' a great mother.\" They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak. \"But you still haven't explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,\" Ron said, gesturing toward Hagrid's bloodstained face. \"Or why you're back so late,\" said Harry. \"Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago —\" \"Who attacked you?\" said Ron. \"I haven' bin attacked!\" said Hagrid emphatically. \"I —\" But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain. \"It's her!\" Ron whispered. \"Get under here!\" Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived beneath the cloak as well. Huddled together they backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Ha-grid looked thoroughly confused. \"Hagrid, hide our mugs!\" Hagrid seized Harry's and Ron's mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang's basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open. Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to see Hagrid's face; she barely reached his navel. \"So,\" she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. \"You're Hagrid, are you?\" Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her bulging eyes rolling in every direction. \"Get away,\" she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face. \"Er — I don' want ter be rude,\" said Hagrid, staring at her, \"but who the ruddy hell are you?\" \"My name is Dolores Umbridge.\" Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione. \"Dolores Umbridge?\" Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. \"I thought you were one o' them Ministry — don' you work with Fudge?\" \"I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,\" said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak. \"I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher —\" \"Tha's brave of yeh,\" said Hagrid, \"there's not many'd take tha' job anymore —\" \"— and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,\" said Umbridge, giving no sign that she had heard him. \"Wha's that?\" said Hagrid, frowning. \"Precisely what I was going to ask,\" said Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione's mug. \"Oh,\" said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood hidden, \"oh, tha' was . . . was Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.\" Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabin's. \"I heard voices,\" she said quietly. \"I was talkin' ter Fang,\" said Hagrid stoutly. \"And was he talking back to you?\" \"Well . . . in a manner o' speakin',\" said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable. \"I sometimes say Fang's near enough human —\" \"There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,\" said Umbridge sleekly. Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth. Luckily, Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge's robes, and she did not appear to have heard. \"Well, I on'y jus' got back,\" said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack. \"Maybe someone came ter call earlier an' I missed em. \"There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.\" \"Well I . . . I don' know why that'd be. . . .\" said Hagrid, tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood, as though asking for help. \"Erm . . .\" Umbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin, looking around carefully. She bent and peered under the bed. She opened Hagrid's cupboards. She passed within two inches of where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled around again and said, \"What has happened to you? How did you sustain those injuries?\" Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in Harry's opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising  all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. \"Oh, I . . . had a bit of an accident,\" he said lamely. \"What sort of accident?\" \"I-I tripped.\" \"You tripped,\" she repeated coolly. \"Yeah, tha's right. Over . . . over a friends broomstick. I don' fly, meself. Well, look at the size o' me, I don' reckon there's a broomstick that'd hold me. Friend o' mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if you've ever seen 'em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, I've had a bit of a ride on one o' them an' it was —\" \"Where have you been?\" asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through Hagrid's babbling. \"Where've I . . . ?\" \"Been, yes,\" she said. \"Term started more than two months ago. Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You left no address. Where have you been?\" There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye. Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously. \"I — I've been away for me health,\" he said. \"For your health,\" said Umbridge. Her eyes traveled over Hagrid's discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto his waistcoat in the silence. \"I see.\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"bit o' — o' fresh air, yeh know —\" \"Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,\" said Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid's face that was not black or purple flushed. \"Well — change o' scene, yeh know —\" \"Mountain scenery?\" said Umbridge swiftly. She knows, Harry thought desperately. \"Mountains?\" Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. \"Nope, South of France fer me. Bit o' sun an' . . . an' sea.\" \"Really?\" said Umbridge. \"You don't have much of a tan.\" \"Yeah . . . well . . . sensitive skin,\" said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out. Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered. Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, \"I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.\" \"Righ',\" said Hagrid, nodding. \"You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough.\" She turned sharply and marched back to the door. \"You're inspectin' us?\" Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after her. \"Oh yes,\" said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle. \"The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Good night.\" She left, closing the door behind her with a snap. Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist. \"Not yet,\" she breathed in his ear. \"She might not be gone yet.\" Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so. \"She's goin' back ter the castle,\" he said in a low voice. \"Blimey . . . inspectin' people, is she?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, pulling the cloak off. \"Trelawney's on probation already. . . .\" \"Um . . . what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione. \"Oh, don' you worry abou' that, I've got a great load o' lessons planned,\" said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again. \"I've bin keepin' a couple o' creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they're some-thin' really special.\" \"Erm . . . special in what way?\" asked Hermione tentatively. \"I'm not sayin',\" said Hagrid happily. \"I don' want ter spoil the surprise.\" \"Look, Hagrid,\" said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense, \"Professor Umbridge won't be at all happy if you bring anything to class that's too dangerous —\" \"Dangerous?\" said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. \"Don' be silly, I wouldn' give yeh anythin' dangerous! I mean, all righ', they can look after themselves —\" \"Hagrid, you've got to pass Umbridge's inspection, and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like that!\" said Hermione earnestly. \"But tha's not very interestin', Hermione,\" said Hagrid. \"The stuff I've got's much more impressive, I've bin bringin' 'em on fer years, I reckon I've got the on'y domestic herd in Britain —\" \"Hagrid . . . please . . .\" said Hermione, a note of real desperation in her voice. \"Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull that's bound to come up in our O.W.L. . . .\" But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing toward the vast bed in the corner. \"Lis'en, it's bin a long day an' it's late,\" he said, patting Hermione gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud. \"Oh — sorry —\" He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes. \"Look, don' you go worryin' abou' me, I promise yeh I've got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I'm back. . . . Now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an' don' forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!\" \"I dunno if you got through to him,\" said Ron a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went. \"Then I'll go back again tomorrow,\" said Hermione determinedly. \"I'll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don't care if she throws out Trelawney but she's not taking Hagrid!\"\n",

      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along. \"Fits, doesn't it?\" he said. \"Remember what Malfoy said on the train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew each other. They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup. . . . I'll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he's going to be feeling really stupid now, isn't he? Didn't work, did it? You only got a scratch! Come here — I'll do it —\" Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he wasCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE flying around and around Harry's head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg. \"There's no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?\" Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. \"You know what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I'm serious.\" Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron. \"Harry's got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,\" she said seriously. \"If that was the first task, I hate to think what's coming next.\" \"Right little ray of sunshine, aren't you?\" said Ron. \"You and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime.\" He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual — Harry hadn't been able to resist giving Sirius a blow-byblow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said, \"Well, we'd better get downstairs for your surprise party, Harry — Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now.\" Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster's Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail's head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire. Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn't believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he'd gotten through the first task, and he wouldn't have to face the second one for three months. \"Blimey, this is heavy,\" said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. \"Open it, Harry, go on! Let's just see what's inside it!\" \"He's supposed to work out the clue on his own,\" Hermione said swiftly. \"It's in the tournament rules. . . .\" \"I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,\" Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily. \"Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!\" several people echoed. Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open. It was hollow and completely empty — but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw. \"Shut it!\" Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"What was that?\" said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again. \"Sounded like a banshee. . . . Maybe you've got to get past one of those next, Harry!\" \"It was someone being tortured!\" said Neville, who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor. \"You're going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!\" \"Don't be a prat, Neville, that's illegal,\" said George. \"They wouldn't use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing . . . maybe you've got to attack him while he's in the shower, Harry.\" \"Want a jam tart, Hermione?\" said Fred. Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her. Fred grinned. \"It's all right,\" he said. \"I haven't done anything to them. It's the custard creams you've got to watch —\" Neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it out. Fred laughed. \"Just my little joke, Neville. . . .\" Hermione took a jam tart. Then she said, \"Did you get all this from the kitchens, Fred?\" \"Yep,\" said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched squeak and imitated a house-elf. \"&lsquo;Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!' They're dead helpful . . . get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.\" \"How do you get in there?\" Hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice. \"Easy,\" said Fred, \"concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and —\" He stopped and looked suspiciously at her. \"Why?\"THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT \"Nothing,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you?\" said George. \"Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?\" Several people chortled. Hermione didn't answer. \"Don't you go upsetting them and telling them they've got to take clothes and salaries!\" said Fred warningly \"You'll put them off their cooking!\" Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary. \"Oh — sorry, Neville!\" Fred shouted over all the laughter. \"I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed —\" Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He even joined in laughing. \"Canary Creams!\" Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. \"George and I invented them — seven Sickles each, a bargain!\" It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he pulled the curtains of his four-poster shut, Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point . . . they were all right, really, dragons. . . . The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty though the castle always was in winter, Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowingCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime's horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the corner of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them. \"I'm not sure whether they hibernate or not,\" Hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. \"Thought we'd jus' try an' see if they fancied a kip . . . we'll jus' settle 'em down in these boxes. . . .\" There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful, scuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets. \"We'll jus' lead 'em in here,\" Hagrid said, \"an' put the lids on, and we'll see what happens.\" But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, \"Don' panic, now, don' panic!\" while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class — Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead — had fled into Hagrid's cabin through the THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left. \"Don' frighten him, now!\" Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. \"Jus' try an' slip the rope 'round his sting, so he won' hurt any o' the others!\" \"Yeah, we wouldn't want that!\" Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid's cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks. \"Well, well, well . . . this does look like fun.\" Rita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid's garden fence, looking in at the mayhem. She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and her crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm. Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby. \"Who're you?\" Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt's sting and tightened it. \"Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,\" Rita replied, beaming at him. Her gold teeth glinted. \"Thought Dumbledore said you weren' allowed inside the school anymore,\" said Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE Rita acted as though she hadn't heard what Hagrid had said. \"What are these fascinating creatures called?\" she asked, beaming still more widely. \"Blast-Ended Skrewts,\" grunted Hagrid. \"Really?\" said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. \"I've never heard of them before . . . where do they come from?\" Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid's wild black beard, and his heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from? Hermione, who seemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly, \"They're very interesting, aren't they? Aren't they, Harry?\" \"What? Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting,\" said Harry as she stepped on his foot. \"Ah, you're here, Harry!\" said Rita Skeeter as she looked around. \"So you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him. \"Lovely,\" said Rita. \"Really lovely. Been teaching long?\" she added to Hagrid. Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear. \"This is o'ny me second year,\" said Hagrid. \"Lovely. . . I don't suppose you'd like to give an interview, would you? Share some of your experience of magical creatures? The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday, as I'm sure you know. We could feature these — er — Bang-Ended Scoots.\"THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT \"Blast-Ended Skrewts,\" Hagrid said eagerly. \"Er — yeah, why not?\" Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week. Then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson. \"Well, good-bye, Harry!\" Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron and Hermione. \"Until Friday night, then, Hagrid!\" \"She'll twist everything he says,\" Harry said under his breath. \"Just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or anything,\" said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another — it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do. \"Hagrid's been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore's never sacked him,\" said Ron consolingly. \"Worst that can happen is Hagrid'll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best.\" Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch. Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again. Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"I would think,\" she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance, \"that some of us\" — she stared very meaningfully at Harry — \"might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night. As I sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its crystalline depths . . . and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?\" \"An ugly old bat in outsize specs?\" Ron muttered under his breath. Harry fought hard to keep his face straight. \"Death, my dears.\" Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking horrified. \"Yes,\" said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, \"it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower . . . ever lower over the castle. . . .\" She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and obviously. \"It'd be a bit more impressive if she hadn't done it about eighty times before,\" Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath Professor Trelawney's room. \"But if I'd dropped dead every time she's told me I'm going to, I'd be a medical miracle.\" \"You'd be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,\" said Ron, chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly. \"At least we didn't get homework. I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not working when she is. . . .\"THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT But Hermione wasn't at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward. The only person in there was Viktor Krum. Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in whispers with Harry whether he should ask for an autograph — but then Ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea. \"Wonder where she's got to?\" Ron said as he and Harry went back to Gryffindor Tower. \"Dunno . . . balderdash.\" But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced Hermione's arrival. \"Harry!\" she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady stared down at her, eyebrows raised). \"Harry, you've got to come — you've got to come, the most amazing thing's happened — please —\" She seized Harry's arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor. \"What's the matter?\" Harry said. \"I'll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick —\" Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued. \"Okay,\" Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up. \"Oh don't mind me!\" the Fat Lady called irritably after them. \"Don't apologize for bothering me! I'll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?\" \"Yeah, thanks!\" Ron shouted over his shoulder. \"Hermione, where are we going?\" Harry asked, after she had ledCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. \"You'll see, you'll see in a minute!\" said Hermione excitedly. She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry's names. Harry had never been through here before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape's dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food. \"Oh hang on . . .\" said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor. \"Wait a minute, Hermione. . . .\" \"What?\" She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face. \"I know what this is about,\" said Harry. He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl. \"Hermione!\" said Ron, cottoning on. \"You're trying to rope us into that spew stuff again!\" \"No, no, I'm not!\" she said hastily. \"And it's not spew, Ron —\" \"Changed the name, have you?\" said Ron, frowning at her. \"What are we now, then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I'm not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work, I'm not doing it —\" \"I'm not asking you to!\" Hermione said impatiently. \"I came down here just now, to talk to them all, and I found — oh come on, Harry, I want to show you!\"THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT She seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl, stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear. It began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside. He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing, \"Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!\" Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break. \"D-Dobby?\" Harry gasped. \"It is Dobby, sir, it is!\" squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel. \"Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!\" Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet — all except the clothes, which were very different. When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinnedCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of what looked like children's soccer shorts, and odd socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one Harry had removed from his own foot and tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free. The other was covered in pink and orange stripes. \"Dobby, what're you doing here?\" Harry said in amazement. \"Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!\" Dobby squealed excitedly. \"Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!\" \"Winky?\" said Harry. \"She's here too?\" \"Yes, sir, yes!\" said Dobby, and he seized Harry's hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above. At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming, bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing the same uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as Winky's had been, like a toga. Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed. \"Winky, sir!\" he said. Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT large ears. However, while every one of Dobby's strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brand-new, Winky was plainly not taking care of her clothes at all. There were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt. \"Hello, Winky,\" said Harry. Winky's lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the Quidditch World Cup. \"Oh dear,\" said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. \"Winky, don't cry, please don't . . .\" But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at Harry. \"Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?\" he squeaked loudly, over Winky's sobs. \"Er — yeah, okay,\" said Harry. Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits. \"Good service!\" Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated. \"How long have you been here, Dobby?\" Harry asked as Dobby handed around the tea. \"Only a week, Harry Potter, sir!\" said Dobby happily. \"Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed —\"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE At this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-tomato of a nose dribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to stem the flow. \"Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!\" Dobby squeaked. \"But Dobby hasn't found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying now!\" The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said, \"Good for you, Dobby!\" \"Thank you, miss!\" said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. \"But most wizards doesn't want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. &lsquo;That's not the point of a house-elf,' they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby's face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid, Harry Potter. . . . Dobby likes being free!\" The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as though he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her crying. \"And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky has been freed too, sir!\" said Dobby delightedly. At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay face-down on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference. Dobby continued with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky's screeches. \"And then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir! &lsquo;Why doesn'tTHE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT Dobby and Winky find work together?' Dobby says. &lsquo;Where is there enough work for two house-elves?' says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir! Hogwarts! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor Dumbledore took us on!\" Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again. \"And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!\" \"That's not very much!\" Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over Winky's continued screaming and fist-beating. \"Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,\" said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, \"but Dobby beat him down, miss. . . . Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn't wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.\" \"And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?\" Hermione asked kindly. If she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious. \"Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!\" she squeaked. \"Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!\" \"Ashamed?\" said Hermione blankly. \"But — Winky, come on! It's Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn't do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you —\"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn't hear a word, and screeched, \"You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr. Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!\" \"Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,\" squeaked Dobby confidentially. \"Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won't do it.\" \"Can't house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?\" Harry asked. \"Oh no, sir, no,\" said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. \" 'Tis part of the house-elf's enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We upholds the family's honor, and we never speaks ill of them — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to — to —\" Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent forward. Dobby whispered, \"He said we is free to call him a — a barmy old codger if we likes, sir!\" Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle. \"But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,\" he said, talking normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped. \"Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him.\" \"But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?\" Harry asked him, grinning. A slightly fearful look came into Dobby's immense eyes. \"Dobby — Dobby could,\" he said doubtfully. He squared hisTHE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT small shoulders. \"Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards!\" Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by his own daring — then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, \"Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!\" Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table. \"Thank you, Harry Potter, thank you,\" said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his head. \"You just need a bit of practice,\" Harry said. \"Practice!\" squealed Winky furiously. \"You is ought to be ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!\" \"They isn't my masters anymore, Winky!\" said Dobby defiantly. \"Dobby doesn't care what they think anymore!\" \"Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!\" moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face once more. \"My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her . . . oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the shame!\" She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled. \"Winky,\" said Hermione firmly, \"I'm quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you. We've seen him, you know —\" \"You is seeing my master?\" said Winky breathlessly, raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at Hermione. \"You is seeing him here at Hogwarts?\" \"Yes,\" said Hermione, \"he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"Mr. Bagman comes too?\" squeaked Winky, and to Harry's great surprise (and Ron's and Hermione's too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again. \"Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My master isn't liking him, oh no, not at all!\" \"Bagman — bad?\" said Harry. \"Oh yes,\" Winky said, nodding her head furiously. \"My master is telling Winky some things! But Winky is not saying . . . Winky — Winky keeps her master's secrets. . . .\" She dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into her skirt, \"Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more! They couldn't get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages. \"Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!\" he said happily, pointing at his bare chest. \"Tell you what, Dobby,\" said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, \"I'll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her. You don't mind maroon, do you?\" Dobby was delighted. \"We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,\" Ron told him, \"but it'll go well with your tea cozy.\" As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies.THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT \"Thanks a lot!\" Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say good night. \"See you, Dobby!\" \"Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?\" Dobby asked tentatively. \" 'Course you can,\" said Harry, and Dobby beamed. \"You know what?\" said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. \"All these years I've been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens — well, it's not exactly difficult, is it? They can't wait to give it away!\" \"I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know,\" said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. \"Dobby coming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it'll dawn on them that they want that too!\" \"Let's hope they don't look too closely at Winky,\" said Harry. \"Oh she'll cheer up,\" said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful. \"Once the shock's worn off, and she's got used to Hog-warts, she'll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man.\" \"She seems to love him,\" said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake). \"Doesn't think much of Bagman, though, does she?\" said Harry. \"Wonder what Crouch says at home about him?\" \"Probably says he's not a very good Head of Department,\" said Hermione, \"and let's face it . . . he's got a point, hasn't he?\" \"I'd still rather work for him than old Crouch,\" said Ron. \"At least Bagman's got a sense of humor.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \"Don't let Percy hear you saying that,\" Hermione said, smiling slightly. \"Yeah, well, Percy wouldn't want to work for anyone with a sense of humor, would he?\" said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair. \"Percy wouldn't recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby's tea cozy.\"\n",

      "Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle. The front door had remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood. \"What sort of time do you call this?\" \"I'm really sorry — I had to go out for something important —\" \"Well, the password changed at midnight, so you'll just have to sleep in the corridor, won't you?\" \"You're joking!\" said Harry. \"Why did it have to change at midnight?\" \"That's the way it is,\" said the Fat Lady. \"If you're angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he's the one who's tightened security.\" \"Fantastic,\" said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. \"Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he's the one who wanted me to —\" \"He is here,\" said a voice behind Harry. \"Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.\" Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff. \"I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,\" said Nick. \"He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.\" \"Where is he?\" said Harry, his heart leaping. \"Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it's a favorite pastime of his —\" \"Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!\" \"Oh — in his office,\" said Nick. \"I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in —\" \"Yeah, he has,\" said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him. \"Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password's still &lsquo;tapeworm'!\" But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying \"toffee &eacute;clairs\" to Dumbledore's gargoyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. \"Enter,\" said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore's office,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows. \"Good gracious, Harry,\" said Dumbledore in surprise. \"To what do I owe this very late pleasure?\" \"Sir — I've got it. I've got the memory from Slughorn.\" Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. \"Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!\" All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn's memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve. \"And now,\" said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. \"Now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .\" Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn's office many years before. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple. And there were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo's gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, \"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\" \"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you,\" said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. \"I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\" Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. \"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn't, and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite —\" Several of the boys tittered again. \"— I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts at the Ministry.\" Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader. \"I don't know that politics would suit me, sir,\" he said when the laughter had died away. \"I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing.\" A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader's famous ancestor. \"Nonsense,\" said Slughorn briskly, \"couldn't be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around. \"Good gracious, is it that time already? You'd better get going, boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\" One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there. \"Look sharp, Tom, you don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect . . .\" \"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\" \"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. . . .\" \"Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?\" Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass. \"Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?\" But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork. \"Not exactly, sir,\" said Riddle. \"I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.\" \"No . . . well . . . you'd be hard-pushed to find a book at Hog-warts that'll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,\" said Slughorn. \"But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you — sorry, I mean, if you can't tell me, obviously — I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could — so I just thought I'd ask —\" It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. \"Well,\" said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, \"well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.\" \"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir,\" said Riddle. His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. \"Well, you split your soul, you see,\" said Slughorn, \"and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form . . .\" Slughorn's face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before: \"I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive.\" \". . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.\" But Riddle's hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. \"How do you split your soul?\" \"Well,\" said Slughorn uncomfortably, \"you must understandCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.\" \"But how do you do it?\" \"By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —\" \"Encase? But how — ?\" \"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!\" said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \"Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer?\" \"No, sir, of course not,\" said Riddle quickly. \"I'm sorry . . . I didn't mean to offend . . .\" \"Not at all, not at all, not offended,\" said Slughorn gruffly. \"It's natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle. \"What I don't understand, though — just out of curiosity — I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven — ?\" \"Merlin's beard, Tom!\" yelped Slughorn. \"Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .\" Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all. \"Of course,\" he muttered, \"this is all hypothetical, what we're discussing, isn't it? All academic . . .\" \"Yes, sir, of course,\" said Riddle quickly. \"But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I've told — that's to say, what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore's particularly fierce about it. . . .\" \"I won't say a word, sir,\" said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . . \"Thank you, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Let us go. . . .\" When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak. \"I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore at last. \"It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. . . .\" Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. \"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \"You think he succeeded then, sir?\" asked Harry. \"He made a Horcrux? And that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\" \"A bit . . . or more,\" said Dumbledore. \"You heard Voldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know — as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.\" Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thoughts, and then said, \"Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\" \"Where?\" asked Harry \"How?\" \"You handed it to me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"The diary, Riddle's diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\" \"I don't understand, sir,\" said Harry. \"Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. . . . a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. \"What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.\" \"I still don't understand,\" said Harry. \"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again.\" \"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted,\" said Harry. \"He wanted people to know he was Slytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time.\" \"Quite correct,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blas&eacute; about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. \"The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made — or been planning to make — more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. \"Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. &lsquo;I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.' That was what you told me he said. &lsquo;Further than anybody,' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring toCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call &lsquo;usual evil' . . .\" \"So he's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?\" said Harry. \"Why couldn't he make a Sorcerer's Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?\" \"Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,\" said Dumbledore. \"But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort. \"While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain their immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see . . . or as close to immortal as any man can be. \"But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: &lsquo;Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most powerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\" \"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or invisible —\" \"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in his body.\" \"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\" \"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been — forgive me the lack of seemly modesty — for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \"But how did you find it?\" \"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts' house. It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. \"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\" \"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be old tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .\" \"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\" \"The diary wasn't that special.\" \"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the  Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.\" \"So, the other Horcruxes?\" said Harry. \"Do you think you know what they are, sir?\" \"I can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\" \"The locket!\" said Harry loudly. \"Hufflepuff 's cup!\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\" Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. \"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hog-warts, sir?\" said Harry. \"To try and find something from one of the other founders?\" \"My thoughts precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.\" \"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry, counting on his fingers. \"Unless he got both?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?\" \"The snake?\" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes?\" \"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the intention of killing you. \"He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. \"As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort's mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\" \"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dumbledore, bowing his head. \"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school?\" \"Correct,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have been looking for a very long time. I think . . . perhaps . . . I may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.\" \"And if you do,\" said Harry quickly, \"can I come with you and help get rid of it?\" Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \"Yes, I think so.\" \"I can?\" said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \"I think you have earned that right.\" Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore's decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. \"Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?\" Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. \"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do.CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\" \"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hog-warts?\" \"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemort's say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary. \"No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius's fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master's soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemort's fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\" Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \"So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?\" \"Yes, I think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.\" \"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —\" \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\" \"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\" \"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have &lsquo;power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means — love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. \"Yes — just love,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!\" \"But it comes to the same —\" \"No, it doesn't!\" said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, \"You are setting too much store by the prophecy!\"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \"But,\" spluttered Harry, \"but you said the prophecy means —\" \"If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?\" \"But,\" said Harry, bewildered, \"but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other —\" \"Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\" \"But —\" \"It is essential that you understand this!\" said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. \"By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort's followers!\" \"Of course I haven't!\" said Harry indignantly. \"He killed my mum and dad!\" \"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! \"But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.\" \"But, sir,\" said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, \"it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or —\" \"Got to?\" said Dumbledore. \"Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\" Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. \"I'd want him finished,\" said Harry quietly. \"And I'd want to do it.\" \"Of course you would!\" cried Dumbledore. \"You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that —\" \"That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\" said Harry. \"Yes.\" But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world.\n",

      "It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore's body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix's silver knife. Harry's voice was still saying, \"Dobby . . . Dobby . . .\" even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back. After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. \"Hermione?\" he said suddenly. \"Where is she?\" \"Ron's taken her inside,\" said Bill. \"She'll be all right.\" Harry looked back down at Dobby. He stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf's body, then dragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket. The sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which heCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR could take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making suggestions about burying the elf. Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry's grief for Dobby seemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean. \"I want to do it properly,\" were the first words of which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. \"Not by magic. Have you got a spade?\" And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives. His scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out . . . though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. . . . On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys' returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness. . . . The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows . . . Horcruxes . . . Hallows . . . Horcruxes . . . Yet he no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out: He felt as though he had been slapped awake again. Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why. . . . And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy. . . . Dumbledore had foreseen that. . . . How much more had he known? Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean. \"How's Hermione?\" \"Better,\" said Ron. \"Fleur's looking after her.\" Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own, and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. Harry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed upon the elf's bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby's head, muffling his batlike ears. \"We should close his eyes.\" Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness.CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur's coats, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf 's eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare. \"There,\" she said softly. \"Now he could be sleeping.\" Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore's funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore's achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. \"I think we ought to say something,\" piped up Luna. \"I'll go first, shall I?\" And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. \"Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It's so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I'll always remember what you did for us. I hope you're happy now.\" She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, \"Yeah . . . thanks, Dobby.\" \"Thanks,\" muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. \"Good-bye, Dobby,\" he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. \"D'you mind if I stay here a moment?\" he asked the others. They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby's head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone's hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock's surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read: HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. He looked down at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar still prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The roomCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening. \". . . lucky that Ginny's on holiday. If she'd been at Hogwarts, they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know she's safe too.\" He looked around and saw Harry standing there. \"I've been getting them all out of the Burrow,\" he explained. \"Moved them to Muriel's. The Death Eaters know Ron's with you now, they're bound to target the family — don't apologize,\" he added at the sight of Harry's expression. \"It was always a matter of time, Dad's been saying so for months. We're the biggest blood-traitor family there is.\" \"How are they protected?\" asked Harry. \"Fidelius Charm. Dad's Secret-Keeper. And we've done it on this cottage too; I'm Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that's hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we'll move them to Muriel's too. There isn't much room here, but she's got plenty. Griphook's legs are on the mend, Fleur's given him Skele-Gro; we could probably move them in an hour or —\" \"No,\" Harry said, and Bill looked startled. \"I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It's important.\" He heard the authority in his own voice, the conviction, the sense of purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobby's grave. All of their faces were turned toward him, looking puzzled. \"I'm going to wash,\" Harry told Bill, looking down at his hands, still covered in mud and Dobby's blood. \"Then I'll need to see them, straightaway.\" He walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark garden. . . . Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come. Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it. Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all. And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too. Harry understood and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling him one thing, his brain quite another. The Dumbledore in Harry's head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers, pressed together as if in prayer. You gave Ron the Deluminator. You understood him. . . . You gave him a way back. . . . And you understood Wormtail too. . . . You knew there was a bit of regret there, somewhere. . . . And if you knew them . . . What did you know about me, Dumbledore? Am I meant to know, but not to seek? Did you know how hard I'd find that? Is that why you made it this difficult? So I'd have time to work that out? Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold rim of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily surprised toCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and there flashed across his mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building he knew extremely well. Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs. \"I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,\" Harry said. \"No,\" said Fleur. \"You will 'ave to wait, 'Arry. Zey are both ill, tired —\" \"I'm sorry,\" he said without heat, \"but it can't wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately — and separately. It's urgent.\" \"Harry, what the hell's going on?\" asked Bill. \"You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she's been tortured, and Ron's just refused to tell me anything —\" \"We can't tell you what we're doing,\" said Harry flatly. \"You're in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We're not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.\" Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at Harry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally Bill said, \"All right. Who do you want to talk to first?\" Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows? \"Griphook,\" Harry said. \"I'll speak to Griphook first.\" His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle. \"Up here, then,\" said Bill, leading the way. Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back. \"I need you two as well!\" he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room. They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved. \"How are you?\" Harry asked Hermione. \"You were amazing — coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that —\" Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed squeeze. \"What are we doing now, Harry?\" he asked. \"You'll see. Come on.\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. Three doors led off it. \"In here,\" said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur's room. It too had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm. Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully upon the bed. Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all. \"I'm sorry to take you out of bed,\" said Harry. \"How are your legs?\" \"Painful,\" replied the goblin. \"But mending.\" He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look: half truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin's sallow skin, his long thin fingers, his black eyes. Fleur had removed his shoes: His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but not by much. His domed head was much bigger than a human's. \"You probably don't remember —\" Harry began.CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR \"— that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you ever visited Gringotts?\" said Griphook. \"I remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very famous.\" Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up. Harry's scar was still prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request, the goblin broke the silence. \"You buried the elf,\" he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous. \"I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes. \"You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.\" \"In what way?\" asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently. \"You dug the grave.\" \"So?\" Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby's grave or not. He gathered himself for the attack. \"Griphook, I need to ask —\" \"You also rescued a goblin.\" \"What?\" \"You brought me here. Saved me.\" \"Well, I take it you're not sorry?\" said Harry a little impatiently. \"No, Harry Potter,\" said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, \"but you are a very odd wizard.\" \"Right,\" said Harry. \"Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.\" The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as though he had never seen anything like him. \"I need to break into a Gringotts vault.\" Harry had not meant to say it so baldly; the words were forced from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad. \"Harry —\" said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. \"Break into a Gringotts vault?\" repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted his position upon the bed. \"It is impossible.\" \"No, it isn't,\" Ron contradicted him. \"It's been done.\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.\" \"The vault in question was empty at the time,\" snapped the goblin, and Harry understood that even though Griphook had left Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defenses being breached. \"Its protection was minimal.\" \"Well, the vault we need to get into isn't empty, and I'm guessing its protection will be pretty powerful,\" said Harry. \"It belongs to the Lestranges.\" He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer. \"You have no chance,\" said Griphook flatly. \"No chance at all. If you seek beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours —\" \"Thief, you have been warned, beware — yeah, I know, I remember,\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR said Harry. \"But I'm not trying to get myself any treasure, I'm not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe that?\" The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry's forehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation. \"If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain,\" said Griphook finally, \"it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.\" \"Wand-carriers,\" repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door. \"The right to carry a wand,\" said the goblin quietly, \"has long been contested between wizards and goblins.\" \"Well, goblins can do magic without wands,\" said Ron. \"That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!\" \"Well, goblins won't share any of their magic either,\" said Ron. \"You won't tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never —\" \"It doesn't matter,\" said Harry, noting Griphook's rising color. \"This isn't about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature —\" Griphook gave a nasty laugh. \"But it is, it is about precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, your race is set still more firmly above mine!  Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?\" \"We do!\" said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. \"We protest! And I'm hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I'm a Mudblood!\" \"Don't call yourself —\" Ron muttered. \"Why shouldn't I?\" said Hermione. \"Mudblood, and proud of it! I've got no higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys'!\" As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat. \"Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?\" she asked. \"Did you know that we've wanted elves to be freed for years?\" (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione's chair.) \"You can't want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!\" The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had shown Harry. \"What do you seek within the Lestranges' vault?\" he asked abruptly. \"The sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one.\" He looked from one to the other of them. \"I think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.\" \"But the fake sword isn't the only thing in that vault, is it?\" asked Harry. \"Perhaps you've seen the other things in there?\" His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar. The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. \"It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our fingers.\" The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione to Ron and then back again. \"So young,\" he said finally, \"to be fighting so many.\" \"Will you help us?\" said Harry. \"We haven't got a hope of breaking in without a goblin's help. You're our one chance.\" \"I shall . . . think about it,\" said Griphook maddeningly. \"But —\" Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. \"Thank you,\" said Harry. The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his short legs. \"I think,\" he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur's bed, \"that the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .\" \"Yeah, of course,\" said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin's eyes as he closed the door upon him. \"Little git,\" whispered Ron. \"He's enjoying keeping us hanging.\" \"Harry,\" whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the still-dark landing, \"are you saying what I think you're saying? Are you saying there's a Horcrux in the Lestranges' vault?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we'd been in there, she was beside herself. Why? What did she think we'd seen, what else did she think we might have taken? Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.\" \"But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who's been, places he's done something important?\" said Ron, looking baffled. \"Was he ever inside the Lestranges' vault?\" \"I don't know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,\" said Harry. \"He never had gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.\" Harry's scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to understand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander. \"I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think he'd have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don't forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it the night he came back, I heard him.\" Harry rubbed his scar. \"I don't think he'd have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me . . . except for Hogwarts.\" When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head. \"You really understand him.\" \"Bits of him,\" said Harry. \"Bits . . . I just wish I'd understood Dumbledore as much. But we'll see. Come on — Ollivander now.\" Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but impressed as they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur's. A weak \"Come in!\" answered them.CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and the freshly dug grave. \"Mr. Ollivander, I'm sorry to disturb you,\" Harry said. \"My dear boy.\" Ollivander's voice was feeble. \"You rescued us. I thought we would die in that place. I can never thank you . . . never thank you . . . enough.\" \"We were glad to do it.\" Harry's scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic . . . yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. Feigning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand. \"Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.\" \"Anything. Anything,\" said the wandmaker weakly. \"Can you mend this? Is it possible?\" Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected halves into his palm. \"Holly and phoenix feather,\" said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. \"Eleven inches. Nice and supple.\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Can you — ?\" \"No,\" whispered Ollivander. \"I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.\" Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys'. \"Can you identify these?\" Harry asked. The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly. \"Walnut and dragon heartstring,\" he said. \"Twelve-and-threequarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.\" \"And this one?\" Ollivander performed the same examination. \"Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.\" \"Was?\" repeated Harry. \"Isn't it still his?\" \"Perhaps not. If you took it —\" \"— I did —\" \"— then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.\" There was silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea. \"You talk about wands like they've got feelings,\" said Harry, \"like they can think for themselves.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR \"The wand chooses the wizard,\" said Ollivander. \"That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.\" \"A person can still use a wand that hasn't chosen them, though?\" asked Harry. \"Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.\" The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound. \"I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,\" said Harry. \"Can I use it safely?\" \"I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master.\" \"So I should use this one?\" said Ron, pulling Wormtail's wand out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander. \"Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand.\" \"And this holds true for all wands, does it?\" asked Harry. \"I think so,\" replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry's face. \"You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.\" \"So, it isn't necessary to kill the previous owner to take true possession of a wand?\" asked Harry. Ollivander swallowed. \"Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.\" \"There are legends, though,\" said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort had decided to put his idea into action. \"Legends about a wand — or wands — that have passed from hand to hand by murder.\" Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. \"Only one wand, I think,\" he whispered. \"And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn't he?\" asked Harry. \"I — how?\" croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help. \"How do you know this?\" \"He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,\" said Harry. Ollivander looked terrified. \"He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I — I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!\" \"I understand,\" said Harry. \"You told him about the twin cores? You said he just had to borrow another wizard's wand?\" Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He nodded slowly. \"But it didn't work,\" Harry went on. \"Mine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you know why that is?\" Ollivander shook his head as slowly as he had just nodded. \"I had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique that night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand should have snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know. . . .\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR \"We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. When You-Know-Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and asked about that other wand, didn't he?\" \"How do you know this?\" Harry did not answer. \"Yes, he asked,\" whispered Ollivander. \"He wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.\" Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted. \"The Dark Lord,\" said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, \"had always been happy with the wand I made him — yew and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches — until he discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.\" \"But he'll know soon, if he doesn't already, that mine's broken beyond repair,\" said Harry quietly. \"No!\" said Hermione, sounding frightened. \"He can't know that, Harry, how could he — ?\" \"Priori Incantatem,\" said Harry. \"We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys', Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells they've cast lately, they'll see that yours broke mine, they'll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they'll realize that I've been using the blackthorn one ever since.\" The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, \"Let's not worry about that now —\" But Mr. Ollivander intervened. \"The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.\" \"And will it?\" \"The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,\" said Ollivander, \"but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable.\" Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when they first met, of how much he liked Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him. \"You — you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?\" asked Hermione. \"Oh yes,\" said Ollivander. \"Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand's course through history. There are gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity.\" \"So you — you don't think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?\" Hermione asked hopefully. \"No,\" said Ollivander. \"Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR \"Mr. Ollivander,\" said Harry, \"you told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn't you?\" Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. \"But how — how do you — ?\" \"Never mind how I know it,\" said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther north. \"You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand?\" \"It was a rumor,\" whispered Ollivander. \"A rumor, years and years ago, long before you were born! I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it would be for business: that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!\" \"Yes, I can see that,\" said Harry. He stood up. \"Mr. Ollivander, one last thing, and then we'll let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?\" \"The — the what?\" asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered. \"The Deathly Hallows.\" \"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. Is this still something to do with wands?\" Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He did not know about the Hallows. \"Thank you,\" said Harry. \"Thank you very much. We'll leave you to get some rest now.\" Ollivander looked stricken. \"He was torturing me!\" he gasped. \"The Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no idea. . . .\" \"I do,\" said Harry. \"I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this.\" He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught a glimpse of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully. It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory was right. He must make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione. \"Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,\" he said. \"I saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn't have it anymore: It was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don't know — but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can't have been that difficult.\" Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him standing there, and see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer. \"And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand.\" \"Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?\" said Ron. \"But then — where is it now?\"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR \"At Hogwarts,\" said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden. \"But then, let's go!\" said Ron urgently. \"Harry, let's go and get it before he does!\" \"It's too late for that,\" said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched his head, trying to help it resist. \"He knows where it is. He's there now.\" \"Harry!\" Ron said furiously. \"How long have you known this — why have we been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone — we could still go —\" \"No,\" said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. \"Hermione's right. Dumbledore didn't want me to have it. He didn't want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.\" \"The unbeatable wand, Harry!\" moaned Ron. \"I'm not supposed to . . . I'm supposed to get the Horcruxes. . . .\" And now everything was cool and dark: The sun was barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake. \"I shall join you in the castle shortly,\" he said in his high, cold voice. \"Leave me now.\" Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape's figure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal himself . . . and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even from his own eyes. And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the beloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright. . . . And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white marble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that heady sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand: How fitting that this would be its last great act. The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long and thin as it had been in life. He raised the wand again. The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken, yet almost perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose: He felt amused derision. Dumbledore's hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, buried with him. Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? Had he thought that the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the wand from Dumbledore's grasp, and as he took it, a shower of sparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last.\n",
