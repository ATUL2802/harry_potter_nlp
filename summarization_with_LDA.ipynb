       " 'Early next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind, as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night. He got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking Ron, and went back down to the deserted common room. Here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter: \\nDear Sirius, \\nI reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to you last time. There\\'s no point coming back, everything\\'s fine here. Don\\'t worry about me, my head feels \\ncompletely normal. \\nHe then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large \\nvase on him halfway along the fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower. \\nThe Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none of the windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor. \\nIt took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him, as she kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tail. She was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night. In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it. \\n\"Just find him, all right?\" Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall. \"Before the dementors do.\" \\nShe nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius\\'s reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them. \\n\"That was a lie, Harry,\" said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had done. \"You didn\\'t imagine your scar hurting and you know it.\" \"So what?\" said Harry. \"He\\'s not going back to Azkaban because of me.\" \\n\"Drop it,\" said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent. \\nHarry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly Moody\\'s Defense Against the Dark Arts. \\nTo their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects. \\n\"But — but you said it\\'s illegal, Professor,\" said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room. \"You said — to use it against another human was —\" \\n\"Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,\" said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. \"If you\\'d rather learn the hard way — when someone\\'s putting it on you so they can control you completely — fine by me. You\\'re excused. Off you go.\" \\nHe pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson. \\nMoody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it. \\n\"Potter,\" Moody growled, \"you next.\" \\nHarry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and said, \"Imperio!\" \\nIt was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him. \\nAnd then he heard Mad-Eye Moody\\'s voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk . . . jump onto the desk. . . . \\nHarry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring. \\nJump onto the desk. . . . \\nWhy, though? Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain. Stupid thing to do, really, said the voice. \\nJump onto the desk. . . . \\nNo, I don\\'t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly . . . no, I don\\'t really want to. . . . \\nJump! NOW ! \\nThe next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping — the result was that he\\'d smashed headlong into the desk, knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps. \\n\"Now, that\\'s more like it!\" growled Moody\\'s voice, and suddenly, Harry felt the empty, echoing feeling in his head disappear. He remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double. \\n\"Look at that, you lot . . . Potter fought! He fought it, and he damn near beat it! We\\'ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention — watch his eyes, that\\'s where you see it — very good, Potter, very good indeed! They\\'ll have trouble controlling you!\" \\n\"The way he talks,\" Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against the Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry through his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw off the curse entirely), \"you\\'d think we were all going to be attacked any second.\" \\n\"Yeah, I know,\" said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step. He had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. \"Talk about paranoid . . .\" Ron glanced nervously over his  \\nshoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and went on. \"No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted &lsquo;Boo\\' behind him on April Fools\\' Day? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we\\'ve got to do?\" \\nAll the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had assigned. \\n\"You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!\" she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles. \"Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer —\" \\n\"We don\\'t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!\" said Dean Thomas indignantly. \\n\"Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that your pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!\" \\nHermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself. \\nHarry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class. She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of  the horrors in store for them — but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes. \\nMeanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century. Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes. They took this one seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms. \\nEven Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-Ended Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate. Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their \"project,\" suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior. \\n\"I will not,\" said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack. \"I see enough of these foul things during lessons, thanks.\" \\nHagrid\\'s smile faded off his face. \\n\"Yeh\\'ll do wha\\' yer told,\" he growled, \"or I\\'ll be takin\\' a leaf outta Professor Moody\\'s book. . . . I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.\" \\nThe Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently the memory of Moody\\'s punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting. Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying,  \\nespecially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year. \\nWhen they arrived in the entrance hall, they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase. Ron, the tallest of the three, stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other two: \\nTRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT \\nThe delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving at 6 o\\'clock on Friday the 30th of October. Lessons will end half an hour early — \\n\"Brilliant!\" said Harry. \"It\\'s Potions last thing on Friday! Snape won\\'t have time to poison us all!\" \\nStudents will return their bags and books to their dormitories and assemble in front of the castle to greet our guests before the Welcoming Feast. \\n\"Only a week away!\" said Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff, emerging from the crowd, his eyes gleaming. \"I wonder if Cedric knows? Think I\\'ll go and tell him. . . .\" \\n\"Cedric?\" said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off. \\n\"Diggory,\" said Harry. \"He must be entering the tournament.\" \"That idiot, Hogwarts champion?\" said Ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase. \\n\"He\\'s not an idiot. You just don\\'t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch,\" said Hermione. \"I\\'ve heard he\\'s a really good student — and he\\'s a prefect.\" \\nShe spoke as though this settled the matter. \\n\"You only like him because he\\'s handsome,\" said Ron scathingly. \\n\"Excuse me, I don\\'t like people just because they\\'re handsome!\" said Hermione indignantly. \\nRon gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like \"Lockhart!\" \\nThe appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from themselves. \\nHarry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-thorough cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces. The suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics. \\nOther members of the staff seemed oddly tense too. \\n\"Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can\\'t even perform a \\nsimple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!\" Professor McGonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus. \\nWhen they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a Hogwarts House: red with a gold lion for Gryffindor, blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw, yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin. Behind the teachers\\' table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a large letter H. \\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at the Gryffindor table. Once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to them. \\n\"It\\'s a bummer, all right,\" George was saying gloomily to Fred. \"But if he won\\'t talk to us in person, we\\'ll have to send him the letter after all. Or we\\'ll stuff it into his hand. He can\\'t avoid us forever.\" \\n\"Who\\'s avoiding you?\" said Ron, sitting down next to them. \\n\"Wish you would,\" said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption. \\n\"What\\'s a bummer?\" Ron asked George. \\n\"Having a nosy git like you for a brother,\" said George. \\n\"You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?\" Harry asked. \"Thought any more about trying to enter?\" \\n\"I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn\\'t telling,\" said George bitterly. \"She just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my raccoon.\" \\n\"Wonder what the tasks are going to be?\" said Ron thoughtfully. \"You know, I bet we could do them, Harry. We\\'ve done dangerous stuff before. . . .\" \\n\"Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven\\'t,\" said Fred. \"McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they\\'ve done the tasks.\" \\n\"Who are the judges?\" Harry asked. \\n\"Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,\" said Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, \"because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.\" \\nShe noticed them all looking at her and said, with her usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had, \"It\\'s all in Hogwarts, A History. Though, of course, that book\\'s not entirely reliable. A Revised History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title. Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School.\" \\n\"What are you on about?\" said Ron, though Harry thought he knew what was coming. \\n\"House-elves!\" said Hermione, her eyes flashing. \"Not once, in over a thousand pages, does Hogwarts, A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves!\" \\nHarry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs. His and Ron\\'s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione\\'s determination to pursue justice for house-elves.  \\nTrue, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous. She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since, first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses. \\n\"You do realize that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your classrooms cleaned, and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved?\" she kept saying fiercely. \\nSome people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop Hermione from glowering at them. A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the whole thing as a joke. \\nRon now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon (both twins had refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George, however, leaned in toward Hermione. \\n\"Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?\" \\n\"No, of course not,\" said Hermione curtly, \"I hardly think students are supposed to —\" \\n\"Well, we have,\" said George, indicating Fred, \"loads of times, to nick food. And we\\'ve met them, and they\\'re happy. They think they\\'ve got the best job in the world —\" \\n\"That\\'s because they\\'re uneducated and brainwashed!\" Hermione began hotly, but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from overhead, which announced the  arrival of the post owls. Harry looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward him. Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry\\'s shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily. \\nHarry pulled off Sirius\\'s reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in further discussions about the Triwizard Tournament, Harry read out Sirius\\'s letter in a whisper to Ron and Hermione. \\nNice try, Harry. \\nI\\'m back in the country and well hidden. I want you to keep \\nme posted on everything that\\'s going on at Hogwarts. Don\\'t use \\nHedwig, keep changing owls, and don\\'t worry about me, just \\nwatch out for yourself. Don\\'t forget what I said about your scar. \\n\"Why d\\'you have to keep changing owls?\" Ron asked in a low voice. \\n\"Hedwig\\'ll attract too much attention,\" said Hermione at once. \"She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he\\'s hiding . . . I mean, they\\'re not native birds, are they?\" \\nHarry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before. He supposed that Sirius managing to get back without being caught was something. He couldn\\'t deny either that the idea that Sirius was much nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn\\'t have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote. \\n\"Thanks, Hedwig,\" he said, stroking her. She hooted sleepily, \\ndipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the Owlery. \\nThere was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day. Nobody was very attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even Potions was more bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter. When the bell rang early, Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall. \\nThe Heads of Houses were ordering their students into lines. \\n\"Weasley, straighten your hat,\" Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron. \"Miss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.\" \\nParvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait. \\n\"Follow me, please,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"First years in front . . . no pushing. . . .\" \\nThey filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle. It was a cold, clear evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparent-looking moon was already shining over the Forbidden Forest. Harry, standing between Ron and Hermione in the fourth row from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years. \\n\"Nearly six,\" said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates. \"How d\\'you reckon they\\'re coming? The train?\" \\n\"I doubt it,\" said Hermione. \\n\"How, then? Broomsticks?\" Harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky. \"I don\\'t think so . . . not from that far away. . . .\" \\n\"A Portkey?\" Ron suggested. \"Or they could Apparate — maybe you\\'re allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from?\" \\n\"You can\\'t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds, how often do I have to tell you?\" said Hermione impatiently. \\nThey scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving; everything was still, silent, and quite as usual. Harry was starting to feel cold. He wished they\\'d hurry up. . . . Maybe the foreign students were preparing a dramatic entrance. . . . He remembered what Mr. Weasley had said back at the campsite before the Quidditch World Cup: \"always the same — we can\\'t resist showing off when we get together. . . .\" \\nAnd then Dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers — \\n\"Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches!\" \\n\"Where?\" said many students eagerly, all looking in different directions. \\n\"There!\" yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest. \\nSomething large, much larger than a broomstick — or, indeed, a hundred broomsticks — was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing larger all the time. \\n\"It\\'s a dragon!\" shrieked one of the first years, losing her head completely. \\n\"Don\\'t be stupid . . . it\\'s a flying house!\" said Dennis Creevey. \\nDennis\\'s guess was closer. . . . As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powder-blue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward \\nthem, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant. \\nThe front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed — then, with an almighty crash that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year\\'s foot, the horses\\' hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes. \\nHarry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened. \\nA boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage — a shoe the size of a child\\'s sled — followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life. The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained. A few people gasped. \\nHarry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights. Yet somehow — maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid — this woman (now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face; large, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky nose. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers. \\nDumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman. \\nHer face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it. \\n\"My dear Madame Maxime,\" he said. \"Welcome to Hogwarts.\" \\n\"Dumbly-dorr,\" said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. \"I \\'ope I find you well?\" \\n\"In excellent form, I thank you,\" said Dumbledore. \\n\"My pupils,\" said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her. \\nHarry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime. They were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads. From what Harry could see of them (they were standing in Madame Maxime\\'s enormous shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces. \\n\" \\'As Karkaroff arrived yet?\" Madame Maxime asked. \\n\"He should be here any moment,\" said Dumbledore. \"Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?\" \\n\"Warm up, I think,\" said Madame Maxime. \"But ze \\'orses —\" \\n\"Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,\" said Dumbledore, \"the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other — er — charges.\" \\n\"Skrewts,\" Ron muttered to Harry, grinning. \\n\"My steeds require — er — forceful \\'andling,\" said Madame Maxime, looking as though she doubted whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts could be up to the job. \"Zey are very strong. . . .\" \\n\"I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \\n\"Very well,\" said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly. \"Will you please inform zis \\'Agrid zat ze \\'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?\" \\n\"It will be attended to,\" said Dumbledore, also bowing. \\n\"Come,\" said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students, and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps. \\n\"How big d\\'you reckon Durmstrang\\'s horses are going to be?\" Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron. \\n\"Well, if they\\'re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won\\'t be able to handle them,\" said Harry. \"That\\'s if he hasn\\'t been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder what\\'s up with them?\" \\n\"Maybe they\\'ve escaped,\" said Ron hopefully. \\n\"Oh don\\'t say that,\" said Hermione with a shudder. \"Imagine that lot loose on the grounds. . . .\" \\nThey stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang party to arrive. Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky. For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame \\nMaxime\\'s huge horses snorting and stamping. But then — \\n\"Can you hear something?\" said Ron suddenly. \\nHarry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed. . . . \\n\"The lake!\" yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it. \"Look at the lake!\" \\nFrom their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water — except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all. Some disturbance was taking place deep in the center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the muddy banks — and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake\\'s floor. . . . \\nWhat seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool . . . and then Harry saw the rigging. . . . \\n\"It\\'s a mast!\" he said to Ron and Hermione. \\nSlowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in the moonlight. It had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though it were a resurrected wreck, and the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes. Finally, with a great sloshing noise, the ship emerged entirely, bobbing on the turbulent water, and began to glide toward the bank. A few moments later, they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows, and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank. \\nPeople were disembarking; they could see their silhouettes \\npassing the lights in the ship\\'s portholes. All of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along the lines of Crabbe and Goyle . . . but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur. But the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort: sleek and silver, like his hair. \\n\"Dumbledore!\" he called heartily as he walked up the slope. \"How are you, my dear fellow, how are you?\" \\n\"Blooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,\" Dumbledore replied. \\nKarkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like Dumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide his rather weak chin. When he reached Dumbledore, he shook hands with both of his own. \\n\"Dear old Hogwarts,\" he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes, which remained cold and shrewd. \"How good it is to be here, how good. . . . Viktor, come along, into the warmth . . . you don\\'t mind, Dumbledore? Viktor has a slight head cold. . . .\" \\nKarkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As the boy passed, Harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He didn\\'t need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile. \\n\"Harry — it\\'s Krum!\"')"

      "When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today.\n",
      "Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him.\n",
      "One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley.\n",
      "He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 2 - THE VANISHING GLASS\n",
      "The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.\n",
      "At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.\n",
      "Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.\n",
      "The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop.\n",
      "It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 3 - THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n",
      "Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\n",
      "The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.\n",
      "The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it.\n",
      "Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.\n",
      "Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window.\n",

      "Chapter 4 - THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n",
      "\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\n",
      "The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.\n",

      "Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.\n",
      "He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 5 - DIAGON ALLEY\n",
      "\"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.\n",

      "I don't see why first years can't have their own.\n",
      "\"Years an' years ago,\" said Hagrid.\n",

      "According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hog-warts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\n",
      "Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\n",
      "Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway  where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it.\n",
      "currently headmaster of hogwarts Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.\n",
      "\"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world —\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 7 - THE SORTING HAT\n",
      "Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.\n",

      "At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor.\n",
      "You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends.\n",

      "Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts.\n",
      "Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.\n",
      "By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\n",

      "Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\n",

      "And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n",

      "Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington died 31st October, 1492 Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon.\n",

      "Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone.\n",
      "When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like \"breathing loudly\" and \"looking happy.\"\n",

      "He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood — A whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.\n",
      "yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it — the Golden Snitch.\n",

      "At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table, set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room.\n",
      "Harry went straight up to the dormitory, collected the Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his birthday, brought them downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it.\n",

      "He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark — \"EXPECTO PATRONUM!\"\n",
      "The screaming inside Harry's head had started again — except this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and louder and softer again — and he could still see  the dementor — it had halted — and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry's wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though Harry's legs felt like water, he was still on his feet — though for how much longer, he wasn't sure — \"Riddikulus!\"\n",

      "turn in early —\" \"I'm staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,\" Harry told Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms, Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him.\n",

      "three — two — one —\" Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan.\n",

      "Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons.\n",
      "It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn't taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons.\n",
      "He had seen the Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn't catch it yet — and if Malfoy saw it — Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Fire-bolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end — it worked.\n",
      "Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward.\n",

      "\"Meet you in the common room,\" Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney's voice called, \"Harry Potter!\"\n",
      "The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and tables to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.\n",

      "Harry's and Hermione's wands shot out of their hands, high in the air, and Black caught them.\n",
      "Harry roared, and with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione's and Ron's restraint and lunged forward — He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man — all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and that he didn't care how much he got hurt in return — Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black didn't raise the wands in time — one of Harry's hands fastened over his wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry's other hand collided with the side of Black's head and they fell, backward, into the wall — Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry's face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of Black it could find.\n",
      "Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black's wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter — He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward it but — \"Argh!\"\n",
      "His eyes flickered over Ron, lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry, standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and bleeding at Harry's feet.\n",

      "Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds.\n",
      "And I looked them up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things .\n",

      "Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning, when the  Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.\n",
      "But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.\n",
      "He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.\n",
      "The only means of escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him — But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.\n",

      "The Weasleys were Harry's favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.\n",
      "Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of Sirius straight away.\n",
      "Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter.\n",

      "Chapter 3 - THE INVITATION\n",
      "By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already seated around the table.\n",

      "The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia's eyes — so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors — simply refused to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.\n",
      "On the other hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys' for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house.\n",

      "It wasn't altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy.\n",
      "From the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken, across the room.\n",

      "\"It's a simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it's only an Engorgement Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct it —\" But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic-stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley's tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.\n",

      "In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry.\n",
      "Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn't been mentioned at all.\n",
      "Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if someone saw Sirius's face within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar — the Ministry would get dragged in — he, Harry, would be questioned about Sirius's whereabouts — Harry heard a tiny pop!\n",

      "Harry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following his progress; its head revolving on its long neck — if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy — but better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again — Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth, but this time he was less lucky — he missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes — He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd, but the cut didn't seem to be deep.\n",
      "Before the dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs — he had taken his hands off his Firebolt — he had seized the golden egg — And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over the stands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up — for the first time, he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd, which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup — \"Look at that!\"\n",
      "Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the enclosure, Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody, and Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him toward them, their smiles evident even from this distance.\n",

      "He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head toward Dudley's face as though about to kiss him.\n",

      "\"Oh no — sorry —\" \"Here, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs. Weasley's charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building.\n",
      "The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before.\n",

      "From what he heard as he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs. Black and Mrs. Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices.\n",

      "Then the rip near the hat's brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into song: In times of old when I was new And Hogwarts barely started The founders of our noble school Thought never to be parted: United by a common goal, They had the selfsame yearning, To make the world's best magic school And pass along their learning.\n",
      "And now the Sorting Hat is here And you all know the score: I sort you into Houses Because that is what I'm for, But this year I'll go further, Listen closely to my song: Though condemned I am to split you Still I worry that it's wrong, Though I must fulfill my duty And must quarter every year Still I wonder whether sorting May not bring the end I fear.\n",

      "Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making.\n",
      "said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.\n",

      "One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid.\n",
      "Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harry's nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck.\n",

      "Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however, Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes.\n",

      "There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely: Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike's flight, then the sidecar began to lose height — In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\n",
      "The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him — Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat — \"I'm comin', Harry, I'm comin'!\"\n",
      "He shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike — Stan — \"Expelliarmus!\"\n",

      "He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream, \"Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house —\" Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below.\n",

      "Frozen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something — his wand — He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking Harry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling.\n",

      "The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup — Alone amongst the dead he stormed up and down, and they passed before him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality — the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen: What if, what if, the boy knew about the others?\n",
      "Dumbledore, who had always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy — But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it?\n",
      "He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin's corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts — A modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack?\n",

      "He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains beyond the village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore; all this in a second, upon landing — and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron's and Hermione's arms, it happened.\n",
      "Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the street, their wands aloft.\n",
      "Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron, and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches.\n",
      "They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters' searching wands.\n",
      "The dementors had retreated, the stars were popping out again, and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-hand side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said, \"Potter, in here, quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 29 - THE LOST DIADEM\n",
      "As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were several screams and yells: \"HARRY!\"\n",
      "Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue.\n",
      "As he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort's scream of fury vibrated inside his head.\n",
      "Harry's scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders.\n",
      "They were standing in a dark corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder's Map.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 30 - THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE\n",
      "Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape —\" \"Let me —\" \"— and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible.\n",
      "\"Potter, we're talking about hundreds of students —\" \"I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won't be interested in anyone who's Disapparating out of the Hog's Head.\"\n",
      "She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape — Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast — \"Minerva!\"\n",
      "And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same.\n",
      "There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army, and Harry's old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 31 - THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS\n",
      "Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall.\n",
      "It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place.\n",
      "Goyle's wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione's second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed.\n",
      "The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room.\n",
      "Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them — And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 32 - THE ELDER WAND\n",
      "Harry's mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying — And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school, and curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads.\n",
      "Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated.\n",
      "Harry directed a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase: Glass shattered to their left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they ran.\n",
      "But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst.\n",
      "Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now: Thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it — He sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 33 - THE PRINCE'S TALE\n",
      "Harry remained kneeling at Snape's side, simply staring down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped to his feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room.\n",
      "Voldemort's voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away.\n",
      "The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape's memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge.\n",
      "One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked.\n",
      "\"Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building.\n",

      "Chapter 34 - THE FOREST AGAIN\n",
      "How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest?CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding inside him.\n",
      "Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him.\n",
      "The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort.\n",
      "Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood.\n",
      "Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between them.\n",
