      "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n",
      "When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today.\n",
      "Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him.\n",
      "One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley.\n",
      "He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter â€” the boy who lived!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 2 - THE VANISHING GLASS\n",
      "The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.\n",
      "At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.\n",
      "Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.\n",
      "The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop.\n",
      "It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 3 - THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n",
      "Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\n",
      "The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.\n",
      "The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it.\n",
      "Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.\n",
      "Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 4 - THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n",
      "\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\n",
      "The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.\n",
      "Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.\n",
      "No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age â€” the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts â€” an' you was only a baby, an' you lived.\"\n",
      "He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley â€” there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain.\n",

      "Chapter 6 - THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\n",
      "Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it â€” but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\n",
      "Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway  where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it.\n",
      "There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in.\n",
      "\"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world â€”\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money.\n",
      "He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 7 - THE SORTING HAT\n",
      "Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right â€” the rest of the school must already be here â€” but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.\n",
      "\"The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.\n",
      "Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.\n",
      "You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends.\n",
      "Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully â€” and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it â€” then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold â€” there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 8 - THE POTIONS MASTER\n",
      "For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\n",
      "It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\n",
      "I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.\n",
      "Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.\n",
      "As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid.\n",

      "Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following â€” they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going â€” they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\n",

      "You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.\n",
      "He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n",

      "On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.\n",
      "Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\n",
      "Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).\n",

      "The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban.\n",
      "And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\n",
      "When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.\n",
      "And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees â€” Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n",

      "Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\n",

      "He seemed to be spinning very fast â€” the roaring in his ears was deafening â€” he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick â€” something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning â€” now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face â€” squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond â€” his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him â€” he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then â€” He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap.\n",
      "In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster's Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power.\n",
      "Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd.\n",
      "The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being  presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart.\n",

      "Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house.\n",
      "If we hurry we'll be able to follow the Hog-warts Express â€”\" And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.\n",
      "Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.\n",
      "Harry's eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight.\n",
      "Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that one for years â€”\" \"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, \"Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 6 - GILDEROY LOCKHART\n",
      "\"Oh, no, Professor, see â€”\" \"Harry, Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder.\n",
      "\"Stupid â€” useless â€” thing â€”\" \"Write home for another one,\" Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker.\n",
      "And it'd be really good if I had one of you\" â€” he looked imploringly at Harry â€” \"maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you?\n",
      "\"If you put another toe out of line â€”\" A knot of Slytherin fifth years nearby laughed loudly at this.\n",
      "Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart's books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 7 - MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS\n",
      "\"None of the other teams have started training yet; we're going to be first off the mark this year â€”\" Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes.\n",
      "When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder.\n",
      "\"And the fourth ball â€”\" \"â€” is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it's very small, very fast, and difficult to catch.\n",
      "And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.\"\n",
      "But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, \"I'll go and get a good seat, Harry!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 8 - THE DEATHDAY PARTY\n",
      "Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch  and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room.\n",
      "The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind.\n",
      "The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.\n",
      "From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends.\n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 9 - THE WRITING ON THE WALL\n",
      "As they entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers.\n",
      "Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls.\n",
      "Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone.\n",
      "After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.\"\n",
      "\"I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,\" Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 10 - THE ROGUE BLUDGER\n",
      "He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy.\n",
      "He didn't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, \"Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero â€”\" The Slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air.\n",
      "He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood â€” A whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.\n",
      "yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it â€” the Golden Snitch.\n",
      "Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out.\n",

      "As half the class lumbered up to Snape's desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed-up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.\n",
      "Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing.\n",
      "said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room.\n",
      "By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.\n",

      "Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private.\n",
      "\"Medicine for my stomach,\" Ron grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that Malfoy hadn't noticed anything.\n",

      "said Malfoy, who obvi- ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary.\n",
      "and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air.\n",
      "The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach.\n",

      "When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them.\n",
      "Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.\n",
      "\"We'll just go, then,\" Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him.\n",
      "The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open.\n",
      "Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car â€” the doors slammed shut â€” Ron didn't touch the accelerator but the car didn't need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders.\n",

      "But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks.\n",

      "The Heir of Slytherin didn't want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened!\n",
      "They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.\n",
      "Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor.\n",

      "The snake's tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned â€” Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.\n",
      "He raised the sword in both his hands â€” The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true â€” Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent's mouth â€” But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow.\n",

      "Harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read: Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.\n",
      "One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry's least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month.\n",

      "At Dudley's fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues.\n",

      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.\n",
      "Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors.\n",

      "Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black's wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter â€” He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward it but â€” \"Argh!\"\n",

      "Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning, when the  Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.\n",
      "But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.\n",
      "He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next â€” for neither family stayed long.\n",
      "The only means of escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him â€” But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.\n",

      "There was no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.\n",
      "The Weasleys were Harry's favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.\n",
      "The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this.\n",

      "By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already seated around the table.\n",

      "The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia's eyes â€” so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors â€” simply refused to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.\n",
      "On the other hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys' for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house.\n",

      "He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, double-checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to September the first, on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.\n",
      "Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the Weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who were identical to the last freckle.\n",

      "Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however, Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes.\n",

      "\"Come on, now, Harry, you'll be late for your next lesson,\" said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragon-skin briefcase.\n",

      "In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.\n",
      "McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain.\n",
      "This was infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: Harry's best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to.\n",

      "\"Time to leave, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly, and as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledore's office.\n",
      "As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over â€” but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledore's refusal to use Voldemort's chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such.\n",

      "Harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so many times before.\n",

      "When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron's Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys' bathroom with Harry.\n",

      "Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slug-horn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.\n",

      "The surface of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the black water.\n",
      "yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm: It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.\n",

      "Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated.\n",
      "Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall.\n",
      "Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now: Thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it â€” He sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches.\n",

      "The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape's memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge.\n",
      "\"You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a â€” a â€”\" Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their owners' arms, over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some already in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart.\n",
      "One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked.\n",
      "From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window.\n",
      "Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room: Snape might just have closed the door.\n",

      "Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive.\n",
      "Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him.\n",
      "The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort.\n",
      "Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood.\n",
      "And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth.\n",
